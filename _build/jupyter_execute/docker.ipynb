    "Let's say you want to write your resume. So you turn on your computer and get to work. Except that when you boot up your operating system informs you that your system is out of date and for security reasons you need to upgrade. So you click OK and watch your computer reboot for the next 30 minutes with a snail-like progress bar underneath a trillion-dollar tech company's logo. Now that your computer is up-to-date with the latest and greatest operating system, it's time to get to work. So you open Microsoft Word only to be told that Word is now outdated, but you can click on the button to get the shiny-new version of Word. You do as you're told and watch another progress bar for a few minutes. Finally the best most cutting-edge window with a plain white background and a blinking cursor appears. You are ready to write the resume. Except, formatting a resume seems like such a pain, with the big fonts at the top, the horizontal lines, and the two columns with both left and right justification, and so on. What would really help is a template! So you click on File, then New from template, then you type resume into the search bar. A couple dozen templates pop up: some with pink backgrounds, a couple with random shapes here and there to convey a sense of style, and several with big smiley photos of people whose job is to model for stock photos. None of these seem to be right for what you need. So you Google search \"Microsoft Word resume templates\" and after a couple ads for new jobs that let you work from home and offer competitive benefits and click here for free trial of be your own boss, you see a website with several hundred additional resume templates for Word. You find one you like, download it, and now that you are ready to finally start writing your resume, you need a break."

    "There is an approach to using Python that mimics the resume example described above. This approach focuses on a computer's **global environment**. One version of Python gets installed globally and gets used for everything involving Python. Packages are installed as needed and upgraded on occasion. If some code breaks due to a versioning conflict, that gets solved by rewriting code, or if necessary, installing an older version of some package. This approach is very common among students and beginners with Python. Of course it is, we are used to Word, not Python! But experienced Python users operate with virtual environments, containers, and virtual machines. This chapter will introduce these topics and get you started managing versions of Python, packages, and external software to make your data science projects resilient to future version updates and deployable universally regardless of someone's own software or hardware."

    "## Installing and Managing Multiple Versions of Python with pyenv\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to install Python on a computer. You can go to the official Python website and download and install the latest version of Python. If you have a Mac, you can use Homebrew to install Python. However, we are going to use a third alternative called pyenv to install new versions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we will be using pyenv is that this package is specifically for downloading and managing multiple versions of Python on a computer. That matters because sometimes code requires a specific version of Python, quite possibly an older version. If you are running Python 3.12, you don't want to get stuck if a package requires Python 3.6. pyenv allows you to install both Python 3.12 and Python 3.6 and switch back and forth as needed. Working with multiple versions of Python is important especially if you are going to be working with virtual environments. Even if you don't need the ability to work with multiple versions of Python, pyenv is a simple way to download new versions of Python and set them as the default for your global computing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do want to use pyenv to update Python, one annoying issue will be that none of your packages will automatically remain installed on the new version of Python. To bring all existing installed packages over to the new version of Python in a global compute environment (as opposed to a virtual environment), follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type `pip freeze < requirements.txt` on the command line. This creates a text file named requirements.txt containing a list of all installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install the new version of Python, then set it as the global version using the steps outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Type on the command line: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all of your previously installed packages will be installed for the new version of Python. Note, however, that for virtual environments and containers this step would be unnecessary as we install only the packages we need for each new project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install pyenv, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv If you are using Windows, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the versions of Python currently installed on your system, type on the command line:  `pyenv versions`\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a new version of Python using pyenv, first take a look at the list of available Python versions for your computer by typing (in either the Mac terminal or in the Windows command line):\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyenv install -l`\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the version you need (say for example version 3.6.10), and type\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyenv install 3.6.10`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the version of Python you need for your virtual environment should be installed and ready to use in the next step. Note that although this last command downloaded and installed this version of Python, it did not set this version as the default on your computer. If you want to make this version your global environmental default, you can next type `eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"` then `pyenv global 3.6.10`, however that's neither required nor recommended unless you want to update Python on your computer. If you did upgrade Python, you can reinstall all the packages you had previously had installed by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`."

    "## Four Levels of Isolation: the Global Environment, Virtual Environments, Containers, and Virtual Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important concepts in software development is the level of isolation of the system you use to develop the software and host an application. According to Wikipedia, isolation is \"a set of different hardware and software technologies designed to protect each process from other processes on the operating system. It does so by preventing process A from writing to process B.\" In other words, an isolated environment does not save any files or install any programs outside that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four approaches with regard to isolation, and as a data scientist/engineer you need to choose the appropriate approach from the outset of your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "The global environment, the default setup of your computer, doesn't isolate anything; a virtual environment isolates the version of Python and the packages installed on that version of Python from everything else on the computer; a container isolates Python and packages as well, but also isolates the computer's operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux) and additional applications from everything else on the computer; and a virtual machine isolates all software and hardware by remotely accessing a separate computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is more information about each approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **global environment** refers to the main computation and storage on your computer that every piece of software shares by default, whether that's your web browser, email client, video games, etc. Unless you take explicit steps to use a virtual environment, container, or virtual machine, you are running your code and downloading packages in the global environment. The global environment is the least isolated option. When you develop software in this location, all kinds of crazy things can happen as your code can accidentally interact with other packages and with other applications installed on your computer. In addition, any changes you make to the system for a project in the global environment can change and potentially break everything else on your computer: for example, if a project requires you to use an older version of Python, changing it here changes it for all the packages you've ever installed to the global environment, and some of those packages might not work anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pros: When everyone first learns Python or any programming language, they work in the global environment. It is straightforward and takes the least amount of time to use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Cons: It is hard to tell how your code will interact with everything else installed on your computer. The way that usually plays out is that you hit some sort of error as you code, so you investigate and debug as you go, but while the adaptations you make resolve the specific errors you encountered, they also make your code much too specific to your particular computer and it won't run anymore on another system. That's a big problem if you are trying to share code that runs and works as intended on someone else's computer. It also means that the software you write in the global environment depends on the versions of the packages you've installed. If you wrote the software using Python 3.8 and numpy 1.18, there's no guarantee the software still works on a system using Python 3.11 and numpy 1.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** (not to be confused with a virtual machine) begins with a new, empty folder on your computer (called the project folder). Once you register this folder as a virtual environment you can install any version of Python you want in this folder and you install the minimum number of packages with specific versions in this folder as well. If you are running Python 3.10 in your global environment, you can run Python 3.8 in this virtual environment. Some packages wreak havoc with other packages (the package for connecting to Google's Colab service also likes to downgrade several dozen other packages to versions at least two years old), and if you need to use a package like this it would be wise to use a virtual environment instead of a global one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pros: Using a dedicated, empty folder for a project helps keep everything organized. Virtual environments allow for easy control of the versions of Python and packages, and allow you to choose the minimum number of packages to install to keep the environment \"clean\". Creating a virtual environment with pipenv also creates a Pipfile that documents the specifications of the environment in a straightforward way.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cons: It takes a good deal of technological sophistication to move from using the global environment to using virtual environments or any other isolated system. That adds to Python's learning curve, which is already steep enough, so virtual environments are best taught to people who want to move quickly beyond the beginner stages. Also, while virtual environments allow for the control of Python and packages, they still operate under a particular computer's operating system. If you wrote software in a virtual environment on a Windows machine, there's no guarantee that it will work on a Mac, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **container** is a virtual environment that adds the ability to change the operating system inside the environment and allows for the installation of other software external to Python, such as database management systems. You can use a container to run Windows on a Mac, or vice versa, or Linux on any system. The major client for building and managing containers is called Docker, and containers can be stored and shared for free via a website called Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pros: A docker container makes software very portable. A developer with a Windows computer, for example, can use a container to develop in Linux. Docker and Docker Hub make heavy software that is difficult and disruptive to install, like an operating system, worlds easier to use on any computer. PostgreSQL and other database management systems are notoriously difficult to install on the global environment but are relatively straightforward to use once you've gotten used to docker. Docker Hub is free to use and very popular, and most important software for data science is installed on a container on Docker Hub that you can install locally with minimal code, and you can upload and share your own containers here too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cons: Docker can be confusing to learn and deploy correctly, and it is another system on top of Python and virtual environments to learn. In addition, depending on the software and files contained within a container, they can get very big very quickly, and big containers can take a long time to deploy on a computer. Some containers are too big to fit on to your computer at all. Finally, although containers use their own operating systems and software, they still depend on your computer's storage and computation hardware. A container can't run more quickly than your computer's processor will allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual machine** (not to be confused with a virtual environment) is an entirely separate computer from your own. Typically (though not necessarily always) virtual machines (VMs) can be accessed through a cloud computing network like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure and physically exist in a data center somewhere: in Charlottesville, most VMs someone will access through AWS are stored in Amazon's massive data center in Ashburn, Virginia. VMs often come pre-loaded with particular sets of software, and cloud compute companies charge you based on the amount of memory a VM uses and on the hardware connected to the VM. You can request a graphics processing unit (GPU) as a processor for your VM, which is several orders of magnitude faster than the standard central processing unit (CPU) you have on your laptop, but be prepared to pay through the nose for that privilege.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pros: A VM is similar to a container in that it allows you to fully control the Python version, the packages, and the operating system and software installed on the VM. Unlike a container, it also allows you to choose different physical resources (such as GPUs) for the system to increase the storage and computational speed of the system. That's crucial for big data applications in which the data are much too big to fit on your laptop and a machine learning model will run far too slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cons: You have to be extremely careful to protect the credentials you use to log in to the VM. There are so many scammers out there running web-scrapers to find files on public websites like GitHub where people saved their cloud compute keys. With these keys the scammer can install things like Bitcoin miners on your VM that drive up the memory consumption of the VM, sending the cryptocurrency to the scammer's wallet, and footing you with the bill. At any rate, cloud systems are yet another system to master on top of everything else, but unlike virtual environments and containers, these are not free and mistakes can end up costing a lot of money."

    "## When Should You Use a Global Environment, Virtual Environment, Container, or Virtual Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main considerations over a choice of environmental management are whether there are conflicts within your own global environment, whether or not you are able to install all the needed software and packages in your global environment, whether and with whom you need to share your code, and whether you need access to more computation and hard disk storage than you have access to on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicts within your global environment occur when some packages only work on a version of Python you do not have, or if packages conflict with one another in a way that breaks a package you need for other projects. Many packages, especially the popular and well-maintained ones, try to stay current to avoid these sorts of conflicts. But sometimes the constant stream of updates leads to one package in the chain of dependencies breaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency_2x.png\" alt=\"A webcomic by XKCD, a legendary webcomic on science, illustrating how changes to one package can break elaborate software.\" width=\"300\"/> \n",

    "<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2347/\">'Dependency', XKCD #2347 by Randall Munroe</a>\n",
    "</p></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "When this happens, you will usually see a cryptic error with the import command. Do some digging and you will usually see posts by other people discussing the conflict of versions, often sharing advice to downgrade some package to an earlier version. If you see issues like this, it is best to use a virtual environment or a container to manage the package versions for a particular project without forcing your global environment to have to get back with out of date versions of Python and of important packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not be able to install all the software and packages you need in your global environment. Package repositories like [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) for R require submissions to work on Mac, Windows, and Linux, but [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), the Python package repository, allows packages that only work with some or even one operating system. If you need a package but have the wrong operating system, you can use a container with the operating system you need for the package installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why you might want to share your code. In academia and science, it is important to make your work reproducible. Reproducibility means allowing someone else to exactly replicate your findings by running the same code you used on the same data. If there is a question of whether the code would produce the same results using different versions of Python and packages, then it is important to supply a Pipfile for a virtual environment along with the code and data. If there is a concern that the code would either not work or generate different results on a different operating system as well, then provide a container with the code, data, and appropriate software included. You might consider a container in either case because that would allow you to use Docker Hub to store the container online, which makes it much easier to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working with big data, you probably need more resources for computation and storage than you have access to on your own computer. In this case you will need to use a virtual machine on a cloud computing service. You can rigidly control the VM's environment, and you can share the VM by either sharing access keys (which you should only do with your direct collaborators) or by creating a container image from the VM and sharing it via Docker Hub or GitHub. But if you don't need access to the physical resources available on the cloud, spinning up a VM might be overkill as it creates more work to manage access and it can cost a significant amount of money. There is another common use of VMs: VMs can be connected to a public IP address and hosted on the internet. If you are writing software such as a dashboard that you want to make accessible on the internet through a URL, using a VM is a good approach."

    "A .env file (a \"dot E-N-V\" file) is a plain text file that is used for storing sensitive pieces of information such as passwords and access keys. We will use these files a lot later in this course when we talk about APIs and again when we talk about databases. A .env contains environmental variables, which are pieces of data that load into the virtual environment used by a script or notebook without having to be defined in the code itself. Think of it this way: say we are trying to use Python to access a system that requires a password. But if we are trying to keep a password secret, it's not good to explicitly type something like `password = 'idancetobieberlikenooneswatching'` into the code. But if we define this password as an environmental variable when we create a virtual environment, then the virtual environment tells Python what the password is without ever having to be typed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the .env file is just a plain text file, you can create a .env file in a number of different ways. In VS Code, click on the file icon at the top of the left-hand toolbar, then the new file button. Then name the file .env with nothing before the period and no other file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the file is saved, you can define the environmental variable by writing the word you will write in the code, an equal sign, and the secret value associated with the word. For example, type the following into the .env file and save the file: `password=idancetobieberlikenooneswatching`. You can define as many environmental variables as you want, just put each one on a new line inside the .env file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that on most computers .env is considered to be a hidden file, so it won't show up by default when looking for files unless you set an option on your computer to display hidden files (Shift + Command + . on a Mac, View > Show > Hidden items within File Explorer on Windows). Also, it is very important that you never include a .env file in the files you post to GitHub or to Docker Hub. Malicious actors know to look for files called .env and will try to exploit the information contained in these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now return to the terminal. Now if you rerun any pipenv run command you should see a message that reads \"Loading .env environmental variables\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a notebook using the virtual enviroment as a kernel, and type `import os` and `password = os.environ['password']` into the first cell. Note that os is part of base Python, so it doesn't have to be separately installed. These two commands create a Python variable called password that contains your secret password, but does not require you to ever type out your password in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "One environmental variable that it is very useful to define when working with pipenv is `PIPENV_CUSTOM_VENV_NAME`. This environmental variable sets a name for the virtual environment we will search for in VS Code. Choosing a short and descriptive name will save us confusion in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful environmental variable is `WORKON_HOME`, which should be set to a directory on your machine where the initialization files for this virtual environment will be saved. Setting this folder will help you find the virtual environment in case VS Code does not find it automatically."

    "\n",
    "Every new system we learn has its own set of terminologies to learn. With Docker, the most important words to learn are Dockerfile, Docker image, Docker container, and Docker compose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Dockerfile** is a plain text file with a lightweight programming syntax that provides instructions for what the container will eventually have installed. In the Dockerfile we can specify the version of Python, the operating system, whether additional software should be installed, and we can provide additional commands such as `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the Python packages we need from a requirements.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Docker image** is a collection of all the files that are needed to create the container. It is similar to a zipped directory or to an installed Python package in that all the necessary files are present, but in its current state it does nothing until it is unzipped, imported, or activated. A Docker image gets built when we process a Dockerfile. If we say in the Dockerfile that we want an installation of Linux with Python 3.9 installed, PostgreSQL, and pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, then the Docker image reads this file and downloads all of these software packages. The image waits for another command to extract all these software to construct the container. Building the Docker image can take a while depending on the size of the software packages we instruct it to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Docker container** is the deployment of a Docker image. When we issue the command to run a Docker image, Docker allocates space on our computer and creates a virtual environment in that space, then it runs all of the software in that virtual environment. Like virtual environments, containers can be accessed either interactively or in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Docker compose file** is a text file with another lightweight coding language that can be used to manage multiple Docker containers. It is important for organizing different containers and efficiently allocating enough space on the system to run all of them. We will need to use Docker compose for running multiple databases, for example, where one Docker container runs a relational database, one container runs a document database, and one runs a graph database."

    "The first step in creating a container is to write a Dockerfile. First, make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and running in the global environment of your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Dockerfile is a plain text file, start by creating a new file in your project directory and saving the file as Dockerfile. Make sure you capitalize the D but not the f, and make sure there is no file extension (so make sure it isn't accidentally saved as Dockerfile.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the top line of the text file, type\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells the Docker image compiler to use the latest version of the Dockerfile syntax, and not to use either an older version nor an experimental version. This line is one that will probably appear at the top of every Dockerfile you write without you having to change it or think too much about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will take an image from Docker Hub as a starting point for the image we want to build. First, find an image on Docker Hub that installs the software you need. For this example, let's use the `python:3.12.5-bookworm` image, which installs the current stable version of Debian Linux and Python 3.12.5. All you need to do to install this image is to write the following line in your Dockerfile:\n",
    "```\n",
    "FROM python:3.12.5-bookworm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now add to this image with additional lines of code. First, remember that the main concept behind a container is isolating the container from the rest of the computer. That means that the files in our project folder are not automatically included in the container. Let's first copy the requirements.txt file into the container by typing\n",
    "```\n",
    "COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The COPY command tells Docker to create a file in the container named requirements.txt, and to create that file by copying the file in the project folder named requirements.txt. The first occurrence of this name refers to what we want to name the file inside the container, and the second occurrence of the name refers to what the file is actually called in the project folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's install the packages in our requirements.txt file by adding this line to the Dockerfile:\n",
    "```\n",
    "RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dockerfiles can also be used in the same way as a .env file to define environmental variables with sensitive data such as passwords and API keys. Using environmental variables means that you don't have to type out your passwords and keys in the Python notebooks and scripts you write. To define an environmental variable named secretpassword, type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ENV secretpassword=whenyourehereyourefamily\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But be careful: if you use a Dockerfile to define environmental variables, then those variables will display in the Dockerfile and can be called and viewed in the container. Don't share your Docker image on Docker Hub or your Dockerfile on GitHub if you've defined environmental variables in the Dockerfile. A better approach would be to share a Docker image with no environmental variables, then write a Dockerfile that you store locally that adds environmental variables to this image. (We'll talk more about how to do that later)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is especially useful for running applications that run continuously, such as dashboards. In this example, we will run JupyterLab inside the container. (In practice, we would likely develop using a virtual environment to work with Python, while letting Docker handle external software and final products. But JupyterLab inside a container is a good example to learn Docker.)\n",

    "Note that we could name the folder anything we want, but if it usually makes sense to give this folder the same name as the project folder where the Dockerfile is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we need to define a port number inside the container for JupyterLab to run on. According to a website called CloudFlare: \"Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages, for instance, even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection.\" JupyterLab, by default, runs on port 8888 on a computer. We need to open this port in the container so that JupyterLab can use it, and we do that with this command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "EXPOSE 8888\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to specify a command for Docker to run when it launches the container. To launch JupyterLab from the command line in our global environment, we type JupyterLab. But within the container, we need to add two arguments: `--ip=0.0.0.0` tells JupyterLab explicitly to run on the local host that exists within the container, and `--allow-root` allows us to run JupyterLab without having to define any specific user accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some reason, Docker wants every word within the command to be passed as a string element within a list. So we have to type the command like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "CMD [\"jupyter\", \"lab\",\"--ip=0.0.0.0\",\"--allow-root\"]\n",
    "```\n",

If port 8888 is already being used (maybe by a local JupyterLab instance) and you wanted JupyterLab to run on port 90 on your computer, for example, you can type `-p 8888:90`.

    "### Using Volumes to Save Your Work and Data Inside a Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you close a Docker container, all of the files and data that exist inside the container get wiped out. To save files, you can use the `docker cp` command described above to copy each file from the container to permanent local storage on your computer. But data is often stored in the working memory of a computer system instead of in a file. If you want data such as Python variables and database records to persist after a container is closed, the best approach is to define and use a Docker volume. Persist means that all the data that exist inside a container when it shuts down get saved and reloaded when the container is restarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two steps to using a volume. First we have to define the volume, then we attach the volume to a Docker image when we use the docker run command to launch a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new volume, type\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker volume create myvolume\n",
    "```\n",
    "The final word in this command can be any name you choose to give the volume. Just remember the name you chose so that you can attach it to containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly is a volume? That's a little hard to understand (it took me a while to wrap my head around it, at least). Without getting too technical, when you install and launch Docker on your computer it automatically and silently starts a container on your computer that runs Ubuntu Linux and contains all of the background code Docker needs to run various Docker commands. This Ubuntu container is always supposed to run only in the background and support the user-facing sides of Docker. When you create a volume, Docker creates a new folder in this background Ubuntu container and saves all of the data from one of your containers in this folder. All of the Docker syntax regarding volumes provides shortcuts to accessing the background container and either pulling data out of this folder or saving data into this folder. This container is also configured to store copies of all its data to a local directory on your computer so that the data is not wiped out when Docker is terminated on the local system.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any rate, now that you have created a volume, you can see it listed in the Docker Desktop dashboard by clicking the Volumes tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have created a volume, we can attach it to a Docker container with the `docker run` command. Let's continue working with the example we used above with the myfirstdocker image here, but you can use any image you want with a volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the container you started is still running, start by closing it. One way to close the container is to type `docker ps` to see a list of running containers. If you see a container you want to shut down, find it's nickname (such as elastic_hertz), then type\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker stop elastic_hertz`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will relaunch the container, this time with attaching a volume with the `-v` flag on the `docker run` command. Type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -p 8888:8888 -v myvolume:/homedirectory myfirstdocker\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `-v myvolume:/homedirectory` option has three parts. First `-v` tells docker run that you are attaching a volume to this container. `myvolume` is the name of the volume you've just created that stores data in the background Docker container. The colon specifies a mapping from the volume to a specific folder inside your container. Recall that when we wrote the Dockerfile for this container we used the WORKDIR command to create a folder called /homedirectory. Here we tell Docker to load the contents of myvolume into the /homedirectory folder when we launch the container, and then to save the contents of /homedirectory into myvolume when we shut down the container. If we write `-v myvolume:/homedirectory` every time we run the container, we can save our work and we can save the data inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it out. Now that the container is running with an attached volume, open a new notebook, type \"This is a test!\" into the first cell and set the cell to display markdown, and save the notebook with some name. Then exit JupyterLab and close the container. Next, restart the container using the exact same command: `docker run -p 8888:8888 -v myvolume:/homedirectory myfirstdocker` You should see the notebook you just saved reappear in the left-hand file window.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to save your container's files inside your project directory instead of a Docker-selected subdirectory, use a period and a forward slash in place of the volume name, like this:\n",

    "### Databases Using Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to store data on a computer. You can save data in a file on your hard drive: that's what you do when you save data in a CSV file, an Excel file, or another specific file type. But you can also save data deep in a hidden folder and access it only through the working memory on your computer, just like any program that runs or any container running on a specific port. A database management system (DBMS) is a program that saves data in this way and also provides a mechanism for accessing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different DBMSs work with different kinds of data. The most common kind of DBMS works with relational databases: data that are stored in a series of tables with rows and columns, where different tables can be merged together based on a set of shared columns. There are other kinds of databases: for example, a document store works with data that usually contains a lot of text, and a graph database works with data that connects observations to other observations in a network. There are many options for DBMSs. Some software is proprietary and expensive, but a lot of DBMS software is free, open-source, and just as good or better than the proprietary options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are notoriously difficult to install. When installing a DBMS locally, it is common for idiosyncratic problems to arise. But Docker makes this all much easier because Docker Hub contains official images for each of these DBMSs. Once we feel comfortable with Docker, it pays off immediately when we want to use databases.\n",

    "\n",
    "While using the docker run command is a perfectly acceptable way to use Docker, there is a better method that replaces docker run called **docker compose**. We will write another file called compose.yaml which contains the same instructions for running a container that the `docker run` command contains. There are two primary advantages of using Docker compose instead of `docker run`. First, it makes our command line code simpler: instead of typing the entire docker run command each time we launch a container, we write the instructions once within the compose.yaml file, and then just type `docker compose up` to to run it. Second, a compose file allows us to run multiple Docker containers at the same time, attach each one to space on our local computers for storing data and files, and allows us to network these containers so that we can use one while working within another. It probably sounds complicated, but once it is set up it makes any data software engineering project much easier.\n",

YAML is similar to key-value paired data structures, like JSON and XML, and is very commonly used in software engineering for configuration files in which a user may want to specify the values of many parameters in one place where it is easier to keep track of what does what. Originally YAML stood for \"Yet Another Markup Language\" as a way to group it with other languages that control visual elements on a website, like HTML and Markdown. But with time YAML became more commonly used for configuration files and less common for front-end visual coding, so today [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/). says that YAML stands for \"YAML ain't markup language.\" \n",

The first part of a compose.yaml file defines the services that we will be using for our project. With docker, a \"service\" is the same thing as a container. The name \"jupyterlab\" can be anything we want, but generally you want to name the service after the primary function that a specific container will serve. In this case, our first container runs Jupyter Lab, so \"jupyterlab\" makes sense, but we might also call it \"development\" as this container will serve as our primary code development environment.\n",

    "### Adding Attached Volumes for Persistent Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you close a Docker container, all of the files and data that exist inside the container get deleted. But there are times in which it is very useful to save files and data locally so that they remain accessible the next time you start the containers. For databases we need volumes to make sure these databases are not erased when we close the containers. Previously we used the `docker volume create` command to create these volumes, but with Docker compose we create the Docker volumes directly within a compose.yaml file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to use a volume to save files and data, depending on where exactly on your local system you would like to save your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1**: saving your files and data in your local project directory. If you are working on scripts, notebooks, or output that you want to save in the same folder with all of the primary files for your project, and then upload it all to GitHub, you can refer to this folder by typing a period and a forward-slash. So in the compose.yaml file, we can attach a local volume to the container's main working directory by adding the following key underneath the jupyterlab service:\n",
    "```\n",
    "volumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ./:/homedirectory\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here the `./` refers to our local project folder, the `:` is the syntax that separates the local storage from the container's storage, and `/homedirectory` is the name of the working directory that we defined in our Dockerfile as part of this container. If we had named the working directory something else, then we would need to write that alternative name here instead of /homedirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 2**: saving your files and data somewhere on your local system other than your project directory. Generally, using this method, you don't care exactly where the data gets saved, so long as it is saved and can be recalled the next time you run the containers. This method is especially useful for running databases in parallel with the primary development environment. For this method, we return to the top level of the compose.yaml file, and create a volumes key after all of the code related to the services key. For example, suppose that we want to run a second container for the postgreSQL database management system, and we want to define a place on our local system for the storage of the data postgreSQL will manage. We can accomplish this by adding the following to our compose.yaml file:\n",
