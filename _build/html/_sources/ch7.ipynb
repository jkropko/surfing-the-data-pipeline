    "## Introduction: The History of the Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The structured query language (SQL) was invented by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in 1974. Chamberlain and Boyce were both young computer scientists working at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, and they met E. F. Codd at a research symposium that Codd organized there. Codd, four years prior, had published the [seminal article that defined the relational model](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf) for databases. Codd's relational model is defined using relational algebra and relational calculus, two notational standards that Codd himself created to elaborate on set theory as applied specifically to data tables. One important property of set theory is that highly abstract mathematical expressions can be expressed in plain language. For example, consider the set $A$ of holidays in the United States during which banks are closed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\{\\text{New Year's Day}, \\text{Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.}, \\\\  \\text{Washington’s Birthday}, \\text{Memorial Day}, \\text{Independence Day}, \\\\  \\text{Labor Day}, \\text{Columbus Day}, \\text{Veterans Day},  \\\\ \\text{Thanksgiving Day}, \\text{Christmas}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also consider the set $B$ of holidays in the United Kingdom during which banks are closed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B = \\{\\text{New Year's Day}, \\text{Good Friday}, \\text{Easter Monday}, \\\\ \\text{Early May bank holiday}, \\text{Spring bank holiday}, \\\\\\text{Summer bank holiday}, \\text{Christmas}, \\text{Boxing Day}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection between sets $A$ and $B$ is a set that consists of all elements that exist with both set $A$ and set $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A \\cap B = \\{\\text{New Year's Day}, \\text{Christmas}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation $A\\cap B$ is a mathematical abstraction of an idea that can be expressed in plain-spoken language: $\\cap$ means \"and\", and $A\\cap B$ means $A$ *and* $B$, or all elements that are in both $A$ *and* $B$. Put another way, $A\\cap B$ is the set of all holidays during which banks are closed in both the United States *and* the United Kingdom. Likewise, every piece of set notation can be expressed semantically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Codd laid out the broad parameters of the relational model in mathematical terms, he did not design software or a physical architecture for a relational database. He explicitly left that work up to future research:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Many questions are raised and left unanswered. For example, only a few of the more important properties of the data sublanguage . . . are mentioned. Neither the purely linguistic details of such a language nor the implementation problems are discussed. Nevertheless, the material presented should be adequate for experienced systems programmers to visualize several approaches (p. 387).\n",
    "\n",
    "Chamberlin and Boyce took up the challenge of writing a programming language to implement Codd's relational model. [As Chamberlin explains](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6359709), their primary goal was to create a version of Codd's set-theoretical relational model that could be expressed in plain language:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The more difficult barrier was at the semantic level. The basic concepts of Codd's languages were adapted from set theory and symbolic logic. This was natural given Codd's background as a mathematician, but Ray and I hoped to design a relational language based on concepts that would be familiar to a wider population of users (p. 78).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the idea behind SQL is to implement Codd's abstract system of using logical statements with set theoretical notation to narrow down the specific records and features in a dataset that a user wishes to read or edit, but to phrase these operations in accessable, plain language. One of the best things about SQL is that once you are used to the language, it reads just like English. That said, Chamberlin admits that SQL \"has not proved to be as accessible to untrained users as Ray and I originally hoped\" ([p. 81](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6359709)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of SQL is that this language is one of the most universal programming languages in existence. It is designed to work with database management systems on any platform, and it works seamlessly within Python, R, C, Java, Javascript, and so on. While the standards for languages and platforms change, SQL has been in continuous use for relational database management since the 1980s and shows no sign of becoming antiquated or being replaced. The SQL syntax exists outside of any individual DBMS, and is maintained by the [American National Standards Institute (ANSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute) and the [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization), two non-profit organizations that facilitate the development of [voluntary consensus standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization) for things like programming languages and hardware. Despite the universality of SQL, however, different DBMSs use slightly different versions of SQL, adding some unique functionality in some cases, and failing to implement the entire SQL standard in others. MySQL for example [lacks the ability to perform a full join](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4796872/how-to-do-a-full-outer-join-in-mysql). PostgreSQL distinguishes itself from other RDBMSs by striving to implement as much of the global SQL standard as possible. While there some important differences in the version of SQL used by different DBMSs, the differences generally apply to very specific situations and all implementations of SQL use mostly the same syntax and can do mostly the same work.

    "### Declarative and Procedural Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is considered to be a [declarative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming), which means that it defines the broad task that a particular computer system must carry out, but it does not define the mechanism through which the system completes the task. For example, SQL can tell a system to access two tables and join them together, but that command must tell a DBMS to access additional code that tells the system how exactly to search and operate on the rows and columns of each data table. A language that provides specific instructions to a system on how to carry out a task - by changing the system state in some way, including how the data exist in the system - is a [procedural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming). The code that a procedural language uses to make these changes on the system is called [imperative code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming). A DBMS can be thought of as a function that takes declarative SQL code as an input, finds and runs the imperative code that carries out the declarative task, and returns the output. MySQL, for example, [uses imperative C and C++ code](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/features.html) to carry out SQL queries."

    "### Popularity of SQL\n",
    "Common standards and the most popular programming languages and environments change all the time. It's an eternal struggle for data scientists as well as programmers of all kinds, and a matter of consistent anxiety. Presently, Python is the most widely used tool for data science, but will we all have to drop Python soon and [teach ourselves Julia](https://towardsdatascience.com/bye-bye-python-hello-julia-9230bff0df62)? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, it is stunning that SQL has been so widely used since the 1970s. According to a [Stack Overflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017), SQL is the one of most widely used programming languages among the people who filled out the survey, second only to Javascript. Taking into account the high-tech biases in this specific sample, it is probably the case the SQL is more widely used than any other language mentioned in this survey. What accounts for this popularity?\n",
    "\n",
    "This [blog post](https://blog.sqlizer.io/posts/sql-43/) argues that SQL achieved this level of longevity because it came to prominence during a time in which many of the baseline standards for the development of computer systems were being invented. As more and more systems were developed in a way that depends on SQL, it became harder to change this standard. But SQL is also simple and highly functional because it is a semantic language that expresses set-theoetical and logical operations. As long as relational databases are used, there's not much functionality that can be added to a query language beyond these foundational mathematical operations, and whatever additional functionality is needed can be added to a version of SQL by a particular DBMS. There are also many different open source and proprietary DBMSs that all employ SQL, so different users can have a choice over many different DBMSs and platforms without having to learn a query language other than SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there's much less of a reason to use SQL when the database is not organized according to the relational model. NoSQL databases have much more flexible schema in general, and can store the data in one big table or in as many tables as there are records, or even datapoints, in the database. In fact, without a relational schema, the notion of a data table makes less sense in general. For example, a document store is a collection of individual records encoded using JSON or XML, and not as tables. These records can be sharded: stored in many corresponding servers in a distributed system to address challenges with the size of the database and the speed with which database transactions are conducted. Without tables, NoSQL DBMSs do not usually use SQL. MongoDB, for example, works with queries that are themselves in JSON format."

    "## Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) Operations\n",
    "**Persistent storage** refers to a system in which [data outlives the process that created it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)). When you work with software that allows you to save a file, the file is stored in persistent storage because it still exists even after you close the software application. Hard drives are examples of persistent storage, as are local and remote servers that store databases. Any persistent storage mechanism must have methods for creating, reading (or loading), updating (or editing), and deleting the data in that storage device. Create, Read, Update, and Delete are the CRUD Operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've previously employed CRUD operations using the `requests` library to use an API or to do web scraping. Like `requests`, SQL and other query languages have CRUD operations. The following table, adapted from a similar one that appears on the [Wikipedia page for the CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete), shows these operations in the `requests` package, SQL, and the MongoDB query language:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Operation|`requests` method|SQL|MongoDB|\n",
    "|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n",
    "|Create|`requests.put()` or `requests.post()`|`INSERT`|`Insert`|\n",
    "|Read|`requests.get()`|`SELECT`|`Find`|\n",
    "|Update|`requests.patch()`|`UPDATE`|`Update`|\n",
    "|Delete|`requests.delete()`|`DELETE`|`Remove`|\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you will most often use read operations to obtain the data you need for your analysis. However, if you are collecting original data for your project, the create, update, and delete operations become much more important. We will discuss all four operations and their variants in the context of SQL and MongoDB below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can work with SQL using `pandas` if we first create an engine that links to a specific DBMS, server, and database with `create_engine` from `sqlalchemy`. Once we do, the `pd.read_sql_query()` function makes read operations straightforward, and the `.execute()` method applied to the engine lets us easily issue create, update, and delete commands."

    "## SQL Style: Capitalization, Quotes, New Lines, Indentation\n",
    "There are many ways to write an SQL query, and when you look at someone else's SQL code you will see a variety of styles. Mostly, with the exception of quotes in some cases, stylistic differences don't change the behavior of the code, but they can have an impact on how easy the code is for other people to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "One requirement for SQL code is that the query must end with a semi-colon, and that no semi-colons appear elsewhere in the query. As long as that requirement is met, other stylistic choices are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The least readable way to write an SQL query is to write the entire code on one line, with no capitalization or indentation. The following code is valid SQL code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "select t.id, t.column1, t.column2, t.column3, r.column4 from table1 t inner join table2 r on t.id = r.id where column1>100 order by column2 desc;\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will discuss exactly what this query does. But for now, let's focus on the presentation of code. SQL uses **clauses** to represent particular functions for reading and writing data. In the above query, `select`, `from`, `inner join`, `on`, `where`, and `order by` are all clauses, and `desc` is an option applied to the `order by` clause. \n",
    "\n",
    "One stylistic choice many people make is to write SQL clauses in capital letters. That helps readers to quickly see the parts of the code that are clauses as opposed to the rest of the code that contains column names, table names, values, and aliases. If we capitalize the clauses and options in the SQL query, it looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT t.id, t.column1, t.column2, t.column3, r.column4 FROM table1 t INNER JOIN table2 r ON t.id = r.id WHERE column1>100 ORDER BY column2 DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another stylistic choice people make to present the code in a more reabable way is to put clauses that are considered distinct enough from other clauses on new lines. The one common exception is `FROM`, which is considered to be closely related to `SELECT` and is often written on the same line as `SELECT`. If we put each clause other than `FROM` on a new line, the query looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT t.id, t.column1, t.column2, t.column3, r.column4 FROM table1 t \n",
    "INNER JOIN table2 r \n",
    "ON t.id = r.id \n",
    "WHERE column1>100 \n",
    "ORDER BY column2 DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Some clauses are considered to be elaborations upon a previous clause. Column names after `SELECT` are usually written on the same line as `SELECT`, but if these columns themselves require functions that take up more space, it is useful to put them on new lines. Likewise, `ON` is considered an elaboration of `INNER JOIN`. These lines of code are often indented to express the dependence on the previous line. If we include indentation in the code, the query is\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    t.id, \n",
    "    t.column1, \n",
    "    t.column2, \n",
    "    t.column3, \n",
    "    r.column4 \n",
    "FROM table1 t \n",
    "INNER JOIN table2 r \n",
    "    ON t.id = r.id \n",
    "WHERE column1>100 \n",
    "ORDER BY column2 DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "I encourage you to develop good habits with how you write the SQL queries, both for other people to read your code, but more importantly, to make it easier for you yourself to read your code. You will be spending a lot of time developing and debugging SQL queries, and anything you do that cuts down the time to understand your own code will save you a lot of time and frustration in the long-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quotes are only used in SQL code when referring to values of a character feature in one of the data tables. When using quotes while working in Python, it is important to use single quotes, not double quotes, to ensure that the quote that is internal to SQL is not read as a termination of the Python variable that contains the SQL code. That is, it is fine to write a clause that looks like `WHERE column = 'value'`, but not `WHERE column = \"value\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of the queries we will write in the following examples, we will store the query as a string variable in Python. We will use the triple-quote syntax, which allows us to write a string that exists on multiple lines. So our SQL query definitions will look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "myquery = \"\"\"\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    t.id, \n",
    "    t.column1, \n",
    "    t.column2, \n",
    "    t.column3, \n",
    "    r.column4 \n",

    "WHERE column1>100 \n",
    "ORDER BY column2 DESC;\n",

    "## SQL Joins\n",
    "The simplest SQL commands for reading data from a database are `SELECT` and `FROM`. In module 6, we issued the following query to read the entire \"reviews\" entity from the wine reviews database:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT * FROM reviews\n",
    "```\n",
    "But this query does not read data from the other entities in the database. It pulls all of the rows and columns from \"reviews\" and it does not manipulate the data within \"reviews\" in any way. That might not be the best way to create a dataframe to conduct analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL read operations get data, but they can also clean data at the same time. Cleaning data is an important challenge. Even when the data are stored in a well-organized database, that organization might not be the right format for the data given the analyses we intend to do. \"[Tidy Data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)\" by Hadley Wickham lays out a philosophy of what it means to clean a dataset. The goal is to put data into a format in which modeling and visualization is as easy as possible. There are two steps: first we create **tidy data** and then we manipulate the data to fit our specific needs. Tidy data is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, [features] and types. In tidy data:\n",
    "> 1. Each [feature] forms a column.\n",
    "> 2. Each observation forms a row.\n",
    "> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table (p. 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the dataset we will use in an analysis must exist in one table, the rows of the table must represent records (also called observations), the columns of the table must represent features, and the rows must represent comparable units. For example, if the data contain records from the 50 U.S. States, there should be a row for each state, and there should not be a row for regions or for the whole country as these units are not comparable to states. Data from a relational database are not generally in tidy format because the relevant data exists in multiple tables. The first step is to combine these tables into one dataset using **join** functions within SQL read operations. There are many different kinds of joins, and the easiest way to see the difference between these types is to see what they do to real data. \n",

    "### Types of Joins\n",
    "Joining data tables is the act of *adding columns* to an existing data table - that is, adding more features to existing records - by matching the rows in one table to the corresponding rows in another table. In a relational database, data tables can include a foreign key which serves as the primary key for another data table. Joins require matching a foreign key in one table to the corresponding primary key in another table. During the join, this foreign key and this primary key are both called **indices**. To perform a join with an SQL query, we specify the two tables in the database we want to join and the index in each table we will match on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the teams database, `city` is a primary key in both the \"nfl\" and \"nba\" tables, which also makes it a foreign key in both tables. Joining the \"nfl\" and \"nba\" tables by matching on `city` creates one data table in which the rows still represent cities and the columns list both the NBA and NFL teams in each city. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not every city has both an NFL and an NBA team. Green Bay, for example, has a football team but no basketball team, and Sacramento has a basketball team but no football team. In a join, every row in a table either **matches** with one or more rows in the other table, or is **unmatched**. In this case, Cleveland in the NFL table is matched to a row in the NBA table because Cleveland has both a football and basketball team, but Oklahoma City in the NBA table is unmatched because there is no row for Oklahoma City in the NFL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between types of joins in SQL is their treatment of unmatched records. The following table summarizes the types of joins:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type of join | Definition                                                                                                                                  |\n",

    "| Full join    | Keep all of the records in both tables whether they are matched or not                                                                      |                     \n",

    "|Natural join | The same as any of the joins listed above, but no need to specify the indices as these are determined automatically by finding columns with the same name. If no columns share the same name, a natural join performs a cross join. If more than one pair of columns share names across the two data tables, natural joins assume that both are part of the index to match on. Use caution.|\n",

    "### Natural Joins\n",
    "One annoying thing about all of the joins shown above is that we end up with two columns that contain the same information. In the case of the team database, we have two `city` columns that are always either equal, or else one is missing. But when one of the `city` columns says \"None\", the team from that table also says \"None\", so the missingness in the `city` column does not provide additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might make sense to use a different kind of join that understands that the two `city` columns contain the same information and includes only one of these columns. A natural join does two things differently from the other joins described here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A natural join removes duplicated columns from the output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A natural join detects the indices automatically by assuming columns that share the same name are part indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "If done correctly, a natural join saves some work constructing the query as the indices are detected automatically, and provides cleaner output. Any of the joins described above can be done as a natural join by adding `NATURAL` in front of `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `FULL`. If there are no columns that share the same name, a natural join instead performs a cross join (described below). \n",

    "Natural joins are controversial, however, and many data scientists choose not to use them at all. The danger is that if two columns unexpectedly have the same name (it can be hard to keep track of all of the features' names in big databases) then a natural join will match on the wrong indices. This [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8696383/difference-between-natural-join-and-inner-join#8696402) gets into this debate, and one response made a forceful argument against natural joins:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Collapsing columns in the output is the least-important aspect of a natural join. The things you need to know are (A) it automatically joins on fields of the same name and (B) it will f--- up your s--- when you least expect it. In my world, using a natural join is grounds for dismissal. . . . Say you have a natural join between `Customers` and `Employees`, joining on `EmployeeID`. Employees also has a `ManagerID` field. Everything's fine. Then, some day, someone adds a `ManagerID` field to the `Customers` table. Your join will not break (that would be a mercy), instead it will now include a second field, and work incorrectly. Thus, a seemingly harmless change can break something only distantly related. VERY BAD. The only upside of a natural join is saving a little typing, and the downside is substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I disagree with this statement as I think natural joins can be elegant and convenient, especially when I want to match on multiple indices. But I agree that natural joins do make it easier to mess up a join, and more caution is needed. To demonstrate how a natural join can go wrong, suppose that in both the NFL and NBA tables the columns were named `city` and `team`. The following code creates versions of these tables with `footballteam` and `basketballteam` each renamed to `team` and stores these tables in the database as \"nfl2\" and \"nba2\": "

    "### Cross Joins\n",
    "A **round robin** is a method of organizing a competitive tournament. In a round robin, every team or participant plays every other team or participant once. A cross join, also called a Cartesian product, is a round robin for matching values of the index in one data table to values of the index in the other data table. Every value of the index in the first data table is matched once to every distinct value of the index in the second data table. Cross joins are memory-intensive: if the first data table has $M$ rows and the second data table has $N$ rows, the cross join output is a data table with $M\\times N$ rows. In general cross joins are not good ways to combine data entities, and they fail to match strictly like units. But cross joins are useful for constructing data that contain all possible pairings, if that's what a situation calls for.\n",

To issue these queries, however, we cannot use the `pd.read_sql_query()` function as this function is only for read operations. Instead, we can use the `.execute()` method as applied to either the cursor for the database we are working with, or the `sqlalchemy` engine. Specific examples are shown below."

    "## Cleaning and Manipulating Data with SQL Read Operations\n",
    "After using joins to combine data tables in the database, the data needs to be manipulated to make the data more convenient to use. That might involve narrowing down the data to a specific subset of interest, performing calculations on the data to generate new features, and changing the appearance of the data. In \"[Tidy Data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)\", Hadley Wickham defines four essential \"verbs\" of data manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Filter: subsetting or removing observations based on some condition.\n",
    "> * Transform: adding or modifying variables. These modifications can involve either a single variable (e.g., log-transformation), or multiple variables (e.g., computing density from weight and volume).\n",
    "> * Aggregate: collapsing multiple values into a single value (e.g., by summing or taking means).\n",
    "> * Sort: changing the order of observations (p. 13).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition it may be necessary to pull only a selection of the columns into the output, or to change the names of the columns to more readable and useful ones. These operations can be performed within SQL read commands by using the `WHERE` clause for filtering, mathematical operators to transform columns, the `GROUP BY` syntax for aggregation, the `ORDER BY`, `ASC`, or `DESC` clauses for sorting, and the `AS` keyword for renaming columns."

    "```\n",
    "SELECT * FROM table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "that pull all of the rows and all of the columns from a single data table. The `*` character is called a [wildcard character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character). When typed by itself, the wildcard captures all of the columns in a table. But sometimes we are interested in only a selection of the columns. In that case, we replace the wildcard with the columns we want to include in the output. The following syntax includes three columns from a specified data table:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Suppose that I want to know the title, variety, price, points, country, and reviewer for all of the wines in the data. Title, variety, price, and points are all in the reviews table, country is in the locations table, and the reviewer (`taster_name`) is in the tasters table. To produce the data I need to join these three tables while also using `SELECT` to identify only the rows I am interested in. Inner joins are appropriate because every wine in the data has both a location and a reviewer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to select columns across multiple tables is to use aliasing, the same way we did for joins. In this case, if we alias the reviews table as `r`, locations as `l`, and tasters as `t`, we can use these same aliases to inform SQL where to find each column in the `SELECT` syntax. \n",

    "### Sorting Data\n",
    "Sorting data refers to rearranging the rows of a dataframe. Sorting is a cosmetic thing to do to data because the order of the rows should not change the meaning of the data both in terms of storage (rearranging the rows should NOT change the meaning of each row), or for most analytical models (rearranging rows won't change the parameter estimates from a linear regression, for example). But sorting is a way to visualize important characteristics about the data and to quickly see important records with maximum and minimum values of key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sort the output data, use the `ORDER BY` syntax within an SQL query. The general syntax for `ORDER BY` is\n",
    "```\n",
    "ORDER BY column1, column2, column3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Writing more than one column is optional. If more than one column is entered, then the second column is used to *break ties* between rows that have the same value of the first column. If a third column is entered, it's used to break ties between rows that have the same value for both the first and second columns. In addition, each column can be sorted in ascending or descending order by typing either `ASC` (this is the default, so typing `ASC` is optional, but useful for making the SQL code more readable) or `DESC` immediately after the column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what are the top rated wines from Virginia? And of these top rated wines, which ones are cheapest? To find out, we issue a query that joins the reviews and locations tables, filters the data to just wines from Virginia, narrows down the columns to just title, points, and price, and sorts first by points, then by price. We sort by points in descending order so the best wines appear first, and we sort by price in ascending order so that the cheapest wines appear first. The syntax for this query is:"

    "In other situations, we might want to transform a column arithmetically or in another way. SQL supports the standard arithmetic operators: `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, and `/` for division. SQL also supports the modulo operator `%` to return the remainder after division (`16 % 5` equals 1, for example, because 16 divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1). SQL also allows the following [arithmetic functions](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_pi.asp):\n",

    "* `EXP(a)` - raises `a` the argument to the power of $e = 2.718...$\n",
    "* `POWER(a,b)` - raises `a` to the power of `b`\n",
    "* `LOG(a)` - takes the natural (base $e$) logarithm of `a`\n",
    "* `LOG10(a)` - takes the common (base 10) logarithm of `a`\n",
    "* `SQRT(a)` - takes the square root of `a`\n",
    "* `ABS(a)` - takes the absolute value of `a`\n",
    "* `CEILING(a)` - rounds values of `a` up to the next whole number\n",
    "* `FLOOR(a)` - rounds values of `a` down to a whole number\n",
    "* `ROUND(a, k)` - rounds values of `a` up or down to the nearest number with `k` decimals\n",
    "* `SIGN(a)` - returns 1 if `a` is positive, -1 if `a` is negative, and 0 if `a` is 0\n",

    "### Data Aggregation\n",
    "If there are columns in the data output that have repeated values, then each distinct value forms a group in the data. Data aggregation is the process of collapsing the data to one row for each group, while summarizing other columns by taking the within-group mean, sum, count, or another statistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregating data requires more attention to the ordering of the clauses in an SQL query than is necessary with other tasks. That is, certain clauses must be entered into the query in a particular order. An SQL query that aggregates data should follow this template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT aggregationfunctions FROM table\n",
    "(any joins happen here)\n",
    "(filtering rows with the WHERE clause happens here)\n",
    "GROUP BY groupingcolumns\n",
    "HAVING (a logical condition involving aggregation functions)\n",
    "(sorting with ORDER BY happens here);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's break down this template line by line. First,\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SELECT aggregationfunctions FROM table`\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation functions work like the arithmetic functions described above. The difference is that instead of working with a single value, like `SQRT()` and `POWER()` do, aggregation functions work with vectors of data and generate summary statistics. They describe how existing columns should be summarized when the data are collapsed. The aggregation functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `COUNT(*)` - an overall count of the number of rows within each group\n",
    "* `COUNT(a)` - a count of the number of non-missing observations of column `a` within each group\n",
    "* `COUNT(DISTINCT a)` - a count of the number of distinct observations of column `a` within each group\n",
    "* `AVG(a)` - the mean of the values of `a` within each group\n",
    "* `SUM(a)` - the sum of the values of `a` within each group\n",
    "* `MAX(a)`- the maximum value of `a` within each group\n",
    "* `MIN(a)`- the minimum value of `a` within each group\n",
    "* `VARIANCE(a)` and `VAR_SAMP(a)` - the population and sample variances, respectively, of the values of `a` within each group\n",
    "* `STDDEV(a)` and `STDDEV_SAMP(a)` - the population and sample standard deviations, respectively, of the values of `a` within each group\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional statistics, like the median, mode, and various quantiles are not included in standard SQL but are available in extensions that are specific to a DBMS, such as the [quantile extension](https://pgxn.org/dist/quantile/) for PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important point about the aggregation functions is that, with the exception of `COUNT()`, they **ignore NULL values**. Suppose that we have a data vector with values (1,3,8,NULL). Because we do not know the value of the fourth value, we cannot calculate the true sum and true mean of the values. However the `SUM()` function in SQL ignores the NULL value and reports the sum as 12, which makes a strong tacit assumption that the NULL value is equal to 0. The `AVG()` function calculates the mean from the observed values, and reports (1+3+8)/3 = 4, but this too makes a strong assumption that the NULL value is exactly 4. There are situations in which calculations from the non-NULL values are appropriate, but it is not correct to make broad claims from these summary statistics when there are missing values in the columns being summarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two lines in the template are placeholders for the syntax we use to join data tables and the syntax we use to filter rows with the `WHERE` clause. There is a great deal of similarity between `WHERE` and `HAVING`, which we will discuss shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth line in the template,\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GROUP BY groupingcolumns`\n",
    "\n",
    "is the key line for activating the aggregation functionality of SQL. `groupingcolumns` can include one or more columns. If one column is listed, the unique values of that column define the groups that will comprise the rows of the output data. If there is more than one column listed, the unique combinations of values from the columns define the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth line in the template uses the `HAVING` clause. `HAVING` is very similar to `WHERE` in that both use logical conditions to identify a selection of the rows to include in the output data. The difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` is that `WHERE` operates on rows in the original data prior to aggregation, and `HAVING` works on rows after aggregation has occurred. One limitation of `HAVING` is that it will not recognize new column names defined in `SELECT`, so the same aggregation functions used in `SELECT` need to be used again in the logical conditions for `HAVING`. Finally, if we want to sort, we can include the `ORDER BY` clause last.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's find out which country produces wines with the highest average score. To do that, we need a query that joins reviews and locations together, includes country name, the average score across wines from that country, and for good measure, a count of the number of wines reviewed from that country. To collapse on country, we can use `GROUP BY`, and to produce the average score and the count of wines we use the `AVG()` and `COUNT()` functions. For presentation purposes, I choose to round the average score to one decimal and to sort the rows from the highest to lowest average score, so that we can immediately see which countries produce the highest-rated wines. The query is:"

    "So the country that produces the best wine is . . . England? Wait, that can't be right. Looking at the results, I see that some of the countries only have a small number of wines reviewed. China, for example, only has one wine review in the database, so we definitely should not put as much confidence in China's mean score as we can for countries with many more reviews like France and the U.S. For a more fair comparison, let's restrict the output to only those countries with at least 500 wines in the database. To filter rows on this condition, we use `HAVING` and not `WHERE` because the condition involves an aggregation function - specifically the count of the number of wines per country. We can rerun the previous query, including the `HAVING` clause:"

That puts an [escape character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character) in front of the quote, which makes it part of the input string and prevents it from being read as the end of the input string. Another approach is to use [prepared statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement) when converting user-entered data into an SQL query. A prepared statement uses placeholders to stand in for the user-supplied data, and treats the data like input into a function: treating the user data this way prevents the entire SQL query from being read as a single string, and prevents SQL injection. For example, instead of inputing the name directly into the query, the database manager can construct the query in Python code (where a database cursor exists and is named `curs`) like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cmd = \"INSERT INTO Students (firstname) VALUES (%s)\"\n",
    "curs.execute(cmd, (name,))\n",
    "```\n",
    "In MySQL and PostgreSQL, `%s` stands in for a parameter to be passed into the query (in SQlite, the stand-in symbol is `?` instead of `%s`). Constructing a query in this way prevents SQL injection attacks. More information about formatting secure SQL code is available at https://bobby-tables.com/, named in honor of this XKCD comic.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist mostly issuing read operations, it is unethical for you to attack a database in this way. If you are testing whether a database is secured against SQL injection attacks, don't try to issue any `DROP` commands as other commands like `SELECT` will reveal the insecurity but won't make changes in the database. If you are building a database that is connected to an interface for users to enter data, please be aware of the SQL injection vulnerability and use prepared statements to guard against it."

    "## MongoDB Queries\n",
    "SQL is a universal language for issuing queries to relational databases, whether the database is managed by SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another RDBMS. For NoSQL databases, however, there is no universal query language. Every DBMS has its own query language, and will provide a guide for learning that language. Some of these guides include the ones for key-value stores in [Redis](https://redis.io/commands) and wide column stores in [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/index.html). Neo4j has developed a programming language called [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/) that is explicitly for issuing queries to graph databases. Of all of these query protocols, the language used by [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/read_queries/) for issuing queries to document stores is one of the most universal because it works entirely with JSONs: queries are written in JSON format and the output is organized in JSON format. All of these query languages include methods for all of the CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important difference between relational and NoSQL databases is the rigidity of the schema that organizes the data. The advantage of the strict organization of a relational database, as illustrated in an ER diagram, is that the data that can be extracted from the database using an SQL query will be clean and mostly immediately ready to be analyzed. The disadvantage is that relational databases have schema that are hard to change once they've been created and populated with data. SQL also, despite the best intentions of the originators of SQL, can be very difficult for people use for some tasks. For extremely large datasets with many tables, it can be extremely difficult to keep track of what data exists in which table. In contrast, NoSQL databases generally have flexible schema that can be changed easily and can vary even from record to record. There are no rules, like the normalization rules, that require that the data be split into different tables, so there is no need for visual maps like ER diagrams. Also, because all of the data for one record exists in the same JSON dictionary, it is easy to use remote, distributed storage to store all of the records. The disadvantage of NoSQL databases is that the data are rarely ready for analysis after a query. It's a buy-now-pay-later situation: the price we pay for the convenience of NoSQL storage and organization is that the output requires more work to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some concepts that are crucial to SQL are not relevant to NoSQL. There are **no joins** in a document store because all the data for a record exist in the same JSON code. As such, we don't have to worry about accomplishing these tasks within a NoSQL query. NoSQL queries in general focus narrowly on the CRUD operations, although MongoDB provides some advanced functionality for searching for patterns within text and ranking documents based on their relevance to given search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following examples, I will use the document store database that we created in module 6, containing the same data on wine reviews that we practiced with above, only in JSON format.

In other situations a feature might contain values that are so large that we want to avoid dealing with this feature if possible.\n",

Alternatively, it is possible to list as many keys in this second clause as we want, so `{'feature1'=1, 'feature2'=1}` extracts `feature1` and `feature2`. In addition, setting the key equal to 0 instead of 1 instructs MongoDB to extract all features *except* the one specified with `'feature'=0`.\n",

    "### Updating Records\n",
    "Updating records in MongoDB is similar to selecting records in that we use the same logical conditions we use for selecting records for identifying the records we want to edit. The `.update_one()` method, applied to a collection, has two arguments. First we specify a logical condition that identifies the records we want to edit. Then we use the `$set` operator to choose specific fields within the existing JSON record to change. If we want, we can even write an entire replacement dictionary for this record, and write it along with `$set`. For example, to identify the record of the wine from Dwyane Wade's winery, we can query `{'location.winery': 'D Wade Cellars'}` as we did in the previous section. Suppose that we want to edit this record so that the price increases to \\\\$45. We can do so with the following code:"

    "We will replace `'keytosearch' with the name of the field in the JSON dictionaries on which we want to search, but we will leave `'text'` as is because this code tells MongoDB to search for text. The code to set the `description` field as the text index in the `winecollection` database is:"

Alternatively, `'$caseSensitive': True` takes case into account when matching records to a query.
