    "In many classroom settings, a professor will give the students a cleaned dataset and will task the students with running a predictive model using the data. In practice, before this kind of modeling can be done, data scientists have to identify the data they need, get access to the data, and find a way for the data to be loaded into a Python environment. That might mean loading data from files or APIs, or extracting data from webpages, or accessing a database. Then data scientists have to manipulate the data so that it is exactly in the format an analytic model expects, and that often involves mastery of SQL and the `pandas` package to manipulate rows and columns of a data matrix, merge and pivot data tables, handle missing data, recode and combine categorical values, along with a myriad of other tasks. And after using a final version of a model to get results, yet more work is needed to communicate the output in a clear way that allows that audience to draw fast and accurate conclusions using data visualizations and interactive dashboards.\n",

    "## Being a Data Scientist Means Knowing How to Get Yourself Unstuck\n",
    "Most of you reading this book would describe yourselves as beginners with Python code and the practice of data science. Being a beginner is a wonderful thing. As a beginner, the rate at which you are learning new skills is faster than it will be at any other point in your career. And the feeling of accomplishment you will feel by writing working code can and should be profound. But one drawback of being a beginner is the feeling of being judged or viewed as insufficient in comparison to more experienced coders who have much more of this programming language memorized. [Imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), a persistent feeling of doubt in one's skills and the feeling of being a fraud, is especially common for students who are just starting out in a new field. And it's only natural to look at people who type and execute code at furious speeds and to think of yourself as an imposter, especially when you keep getting errors when you try to execute your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the secret: problems, errors, and anomalies in your code are inevitable. And that's true whether you are a beginner or a programmer with decades of experience. It would be accurate to describe a workday of a data scientist as moving from one error to the next to the next. It is simply the nature of using a big programming language like Python that includes so many user-written and open source extensions. So you will feel at times like all you do is generate errors with your code. This feeling is natural, and it is a universal feeling that all data scientists share regardless of their experience level. What sets experienced data scientists apart is their skill in using help resources fix bugs and to to get to the right answer, **as quickly as possible**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a student, you often have access to an instructor who can answer questions and help you work out the bugs in your code. But as a practitioner you might not have access to someone with the experience and time to help you with your code in a one-on-one way. Some proprietary software sells access to helplines and consulting, but open source projects like Python depend on the community of Python users to provide this support. The more popular an open source software package the bigger the community and the better the resources to help programmers solve problems. And it just so happens that [Python is the most popular programming language in the world](https://linuxiac.com/python-the-most-popular-programming-language/), and there are some incredible resources available to anyone working with Python. So the most important skill to master to become an advanced data programmer is participating in this community to quickly find answers to the problems that arise as you code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will discuss the various methods and resources at your disposal for finding help. Some of the methods provide quick assistance but focus on smaller issues, some methods are slower but help you solve harder problems, and some methods are only useful for certain situations. In general, it is best practice to start with quicker methods and to only move to slower methods if you can't find a solution with a quicker one; so there is an *order* in which you should employ each resource. If you practice using these help methods and memorize the order in which to try using each one, you won't have any trouble squashing all the bugs in your code.\n",

    "## The Places to Go For Help, In Order\n",
    "There are many resources available to you. I suggest using the following resources in a particular order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Reading and understanding Python errors\n",
    "2.  Python documentation\n",
    "3.  Google\n",
    "4.  Stack Overflow\n",
    "5.  PySlackers and Python Discord\n",
    "6.  Internet relay chat (IRC) rooms with other Python users\n",
    "7.  Various Python mailing lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of these resources are ones which are officially recognized and recommended by the Python Software Foundation, the nonprofit organization that maintains the official Python distribution. See  https://www.python.org/community/ for more information about these resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please notice, many programmers use Google and Stack Overflow as their first options for getting help. I strongly suggest that you do **not** look to Google and Stack Overflow before trying to use the official Python built-in documentation. The documentation isn't as intuitive and easy to access as Google, but the answers that the official documentation will provide are guaranteed to be correct and specific to the functions you are trying to use, if you know what those functions are. In contrast, for all of the strengths of Google and Stack Overflow, there is a lot of information out there that isn't especially helpful and will slow you down a great deal."

    "## Method 1: Reading and Understanding Python Errors\n",
    "Usually, when you are stuck, it's because you ran some code that resulted in an error. Reading and *understanding* the error is the single most important and useful way to get yourself unstuck. These errors are not aesthetically pleasing, and they are written in technical language, but the intention of these error messages is to tell you exactly what went wrong. Many new Python users skip reading the errors entirely, which is a shame because the error might indicate exactly the fastest way to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons why people skip over reading the errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The error appears in a big pink box with pea green and cyan text inside of it. It's pretty ugly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The first several lines of code are reserved for a function's **traceback**. The traceback is an attempt to isolate the particular line of code within a larger function that causes the error. However, the traceback is often very technical and not especially useful. After reading the first few lines of the traceback, most people give up on the entire error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the useful part of the error message occurs **at the bottom of the message**. The traceback is useful when developing new functions and debugging original software. But the vast majority of the time, whenever you are using pre-programmed functions, only the bottom of the error message matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in chapter 2 we will discuss loading electonic data files. Many things can go wrong. One error we will contend with comes from the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pandas import read_csv\n",
    "url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkropko/DS-6001/master/localdata/anes_example_toplines.csv\"\n",
    "anes = read_csv(url)\n",
    "```\n",
    "What this code is supposed to do is not important at the moment. It produces the following error output:\n",
    "![](error.png)"

    "None of this output helps me understand my mistake until I reach the final line that begins `ParserError`. With a little bit of experience, I can understand this error: it says that it expected the fifth row of the data file to have one column, but instead it found 168 columns. That's useful - it tells me that the first four rows of the data file do not contain the data I need, probably because the data authors put text or citation information at the top of the file - but I had to wade through dozens of lines of technicality to arrive at the useful error message. \n",

    "## Method 2: Using the Built-in Python Documentation \n",
    "Packages, modules, classes and functions in Python have built-in documentation that you can display directly in the console or in the output of a notebook. These built-in documentations are called **docstrings**. The docstring, and not Google, should be the first place to look for help with specific, pre-built Python code as it conveys guidance directly from the code's authors. In contrast, going to Google first often turns up blogs and posts in which another secondary user describes the code, and that will be more prone to misinterpretations and mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Console Window in JupyterLab\n",
    "In my experience working with new Python programmers, beginners are very reluctant to use the docstrings. That's unfortunate because docstrings are fast and accurate ways to solve issues with using existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for this reluctance is that calling up a docstring is annoying in a Jupyter notebook. Ideally, you should be working with two windows side by side: one for the notebook or script that contains your code, and one for viewing docstrings. Another reason new users don't use docstrings is that the help documentation isn't accessable until the packages that contain the relevant functions are loaded into the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a procedure you can use to make viewing docstrings easier with Jupyter notebooks. With a little practice it can become a good habit that saves you a great deal of time in the long-run:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use JupyterLab and open the notebook you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the entire notebook (or at least everything up to an error you are trying to fix).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Right click somewhere in the notebook and select \"New Console for Notebook\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Click on the tab for the new console window and drag it to the right so that it occupies the left-side of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly suggest using JupyterLab (not just Jupyter Notebook), which is available from  Anaconda Navigator: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/. JupyterLab has a numnber of features to make it easier to use relative to the regular Jupyter Notebook interface. One of those features is the ability to open consoles with the same kernel as an open notebook, and another feature is the ability to move tabs so that they occupy a portion of the screen to the left or right, on the top or bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure listed above gives you a visible and separate place to view docstrings. It also loads the same kernel as the notebook you are working on, so that if you've imported `pandas`, for example, `pandas` is also loaded into the console so that you can call the docstring for any `pandas` module or function. Keeping this console open will help you more easily integrate calling and reading docstrings into your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Call Up and Read a Docstring\n",
    "There are many different kinds of code objects in Python that have attached docstrings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A package itself, such as `pandas` or `matplotlib`,\n",
    "\n",
    "* A module: a named subset of the code within a package that focuses on a specific topic. One example is the `matplotlib.pyplot` module which handles all of the functions to display the graphics constructed with other functions within the `matplotlib` package for data visualization,\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function, either within the base Python code such as `print()`, or within a package or module such as `pandas.read_csv()`,\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Python variable that you, the user, has created. Some types of variables have associated **attributes** and **methods**. An attribute is another Python variable that can be extracted from the one you created. For example, if you create a data frame with the `pandas` package and name it `mydataframe`, it has an attribute `mydataframe.columns` that is a list of the names of the columns of your data frame. A method is a function that operates on this data frame. For example, typing `mydataframe.corr()` calculates the correlation between all pairs of columns in the data. (One easy way to tell the difference between attributes and methods is that attributes do not use parentheses, and methods must always use parentheses.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To display the docstring, replace the word \"helpme\" with the name of the relevant package, module, function, or variable in one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `help(helpme)` displays the entire docstring for the package, module, function, or variable in question. If `helpme` is a user-defined variable, this method displays the attributes and methods available for the variable, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `helpme?` or `?helpme` displays an abbreviated docstring, as well as the\n",
    "signature (the complete function syntax, including all arguments and their default values). However, if `helpme` is a user-defined variable, this method does not display the attributes and methods available for the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `helpme??` or `??helpme` is the same as `help(helpme)` but shows the internal code for the function and methods if applicable and possible.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "skiprows : list-like, int or callable, optional\n",
    "    Line numbers to skip (0-indexed) or number of lines to skip (int)\n",
    "    at the start of the file.\n",
    "```\n",
    "So I can just include `skiprows=4` as a parameter within `pd.read_csv()`. But if I turn to Google, I can issue the following search:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python pd.read_csv how to skip rows at the top\n",
    "```\n",
    "Google will often take you to Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) before other websites with coding information. In this case, the first hit is [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27325652/python-pandas-read-csv-skip-rows-but-keep-header) which shows me the `skiprows` parameter, but tailors the advice to this particular individual's use case which requires keeping the first row and skipping rows 2 through 11, something not relevant to me in this case. I can get to the right answer this way, but it is slower than going directly to the docstring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Overflow is by far the most widely used and informative repository of coding help and knowledge on the internet. But before we discuss Stack Overflow in more detail, there are other useful and credible websites that often appear when using a Google search to solve a coding problem:\n",

    "## How to Avoid Toxicity in Online Communities\n",
    "The next options involve becoming a **responsible, respectful** member of the worldwide community of Python users. Open-source platforms like Python and R depend on a community of volunteers who develop and maintain the tools that we use. All of these people are doing volunteer work for the common good, and that's a beautiful thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Python itself, Stack Overflow, Slack, Discord, the Freenode IRC, and mailing lists are online communities for Python users. But, like any online community, there's the potential for a toxic culture to destroy everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a toxic culture? How do you know one when you see one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Toxic cultures are more likely when\n",
    "\n",
    "* members are allowed to be anonymous (see [Lapidot-Lefler and Barak 2011](https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/health-jones-lapidotlefler-2012.pdf))\n",
    "* and members up-vote and down-vote and comment on each other's contributions (see [Massanari 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444815608807)).\n",
    "\n",
    "A culture can be either actively or passively toxic. Actively toxic communities are easy to identify. They encourage and are characterized by overt sexism, racism, bigotry, and calls for violence or other aggression against individuals. Most of the toxicity you will encounter in online programming and data science communities is not actively, but passively toxic. Passive toxicity is characterized by **gate-keeping**: Subtle behaviors that discourage people with less experience, or with some social anxiety, from participating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack overflow, IRCs, and mailing lists are notorious for passive toxic behavior. Passive toxicity is a bigger problem for us than active toxicity because actively toxic behavior is usually explicitly banned by codes of conduct, and individuals are often unaware of when they are acting in a passively toxic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of passive toxic behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Condescending language**: often people who are trying to earnestly answer a question unthinkingly use language that makes someone feel dumb for asking the question. If you are answering a question on an online programming forum, avoid using words such as \"obviously\", \"clearly\", \"actually\", \"just\", or \"that should be easy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shaming**: making an implication, even a very slight one, on someone's intelligence or work ethic instead of giving people the benefit of assuming they've tried other avenues before posting. Some subtle examples include saying \"google it\", or \"read the manual\", implying that the questioner must not have tried these methods first. Sometimes people shame others more aggressively on these forums by saying things like \"Learn to debug your own code\" and \"If you don't get this, you have no business being a data scientist\", but hopefully that's becoming more rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Downvotes without explanation**: this can be both confusing and very upsetting to anyone, especially to people with less experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Virtue signaling**: implying that people are superior/inferior because of the language, software, or methods they use. For example: \"Real programmers don't use for loops\", \"You still use SAS?\", and so many memes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/fU0szLnA4FwuYk3sMNqdf6f21vM_lvC9O-VgjyT11ek.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=7634d370c0a5a46b794e8426850137538eadb615\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"/>\n",

    "<a href=\"https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2019/02/07/statswars/\">'Statswars' by Kieran Healy</a>\n",
    "</p></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Authoritarianism**: Abusing people for failing to follow all of a community's rules for asking questions. For example, a comment that entirely ignores the content of the question but comments \"all questions must provide an example,\" or editing a user's post to remove where they wrote \"Hi everyone\" and \"thanks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overzealous curation**: Being very quick to tag a question as a \"duplicate\" without checking to see nuanced ways in which the question comes from a new situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of passive toxicity is that many potential community members choose not to participate in the community because their initial experiences made them feel ashamed, confused, or belittled. In addition, other potential new members observe these negative interactions involving other members, and choose to disengage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passive toxicity shrinks the community and makes it more homogeneous. Across society, small, homogeneous communities are much more likely to exclude or discriminate against people based on sex, race, class, language and other factors. And that leads to many ethical problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, most of time when someone is exhibiting passively toxic behavior on a forum, they are well-intentioned but are not thinking about how their responses will be perceived. Very few people deliberately contribute to a toxic online culture, but many people do contribute by failing to empathize with the questioner and by not choosing words carefully. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please keep the behaviors described here in mind when you engage in online communities, and avoid them. Think about your words and place yourself in the position of the original poster before submitting a response, and make the edits that you think would lead to a better online interaction. Don't be afraid to call out other people who behave in these ways. And if you are yourself the person who posts, be aware that these behaviors still happen much too frequently, but know that despite this, most people on these forums mean well."

    "This can be frightening. A lot of the time, people answering questions on Stack Overflow can be, well ... huge assholes that cause [real suffering](https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52). You might choose to avoid posting to Stack Overflow, so as not to support a website that has harbored abuse. That's completely fair. If you do post to Stack Overflow, you are likely to get some very useful responses if you follow some guidelines. There's [a strategy for getting good responses](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). You are more likely to get a good response if you follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Stack Overflow and Google to see if the question has already been answered.** Commenters dislike if the same question is asked repeatedly. This [poor guy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27885020/find-all-possible-combinations-of-letters-in-a-string-in-python) got roasted for posing a \"duplicate\" question. (An aside: *Why?* It's not like Stack Overflow is running out of space on their website.  There's an idea that Stack Overflow should be a central repository of knowledge. That means there should be one canonical answer to one question. But people often take this much too far. There are kinder ways to point to an existing answer.) So spend a significant amount of time digging through the internet. If there's something similar, but not quite what you need, you can say so in your post.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write a good title for your post.** A good title is specific about the problem, and also succinct:\n",
    "  * Bad: Problem with matplotlib (not specific)\n",
    "  * Also Bad: How do I place the labels of cars in a scatterplot of the weight and miles per gallon of cars onto the points in the scatterplot using matplotlob 3.3.1 on Python 3.7.4 on Mac OSX 10.14.5? (not succinct)\n",
    "  * Good: How to place labels on top of points in a matplotlib scatterplot?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Start the post with a paragraph describing the problem in more detail.** Some good things to include in this paragraph:\n",
    "  * The context of the problem: how did you come across the problem? Describe the overall goal, not the just the buggy step.\n",
    "  * What you've already tried to solve the problem, and what happened.\n",
    "  * What is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n",
    "  * You can write the version of Python you are using, the version of the modules, and the operating system on your computer, in case the problem turns out to be specific to an old version of one of those things.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If possible, **include code that reproduces the problem.** The code should not simply be the code in your script that isn't working. It needs to be able to work on someone else's computer. That means the code should not depend on any specific data files, and should not contain file addresses that refer to a location on your computer. If possible, only use modules that are easy to get. If the code needs to run on data, can you use something pre-loaded in Python that everyone can access? (There are example datasets included with `scikit-learn`, for example.) Make the code as short and stripped down as possible while still producing the behavior or error that needs to be fixed, and use comments to help people understand the code more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few additional things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be courteous and respectful. Respond to and thank everyone who comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Post a follow-up once the problem is solved so that people who come across this page in the future with the same problem know the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't ask people to write code for you. It's better to request help with code your provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't claim you found a bug in Python or in a module. It's a bit rude to the people who programmed the code (who don't get paid).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't ask about homework problems. ([Here's an example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23098699/calculate-the-mean-of-one-column-from-several-csv-files-in-r) of someone getting called out on this.)"
