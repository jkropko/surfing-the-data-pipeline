    "## Introduction: What is an API?\n",
    "### Transfering Data Over the Internet\n",
    "Where do we get our data? That depends on who is providing the data. In the simplest of cases, the data provider gives us a single file in CSV or JSON format. But some of the most important data providers are extremely big operations: social media companies, search engines, governments, finance firms, etc. Getting data from these organizations is more complicated than asking for a data file, but it is very possible to do using the application programming interfaces (APIs) that these organizations have set-up and made available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not feasible for these organizations to interact personally with every individual who requests data because every request may be unique, asking for different records, features, timeframes, locations, and formatting. In addition, to fulfill a request, the data provider might need information from the data requester first: for example, if I want Google Maps to give me the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of my house, I first need to tell Google Maps my address. In short, there are too many requests for humans to handle given that each request requires a conversation between the person providing the data and the person requesting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations instead store and share their data electronically through automated **web applications**. A web application has three parts: the user interface (the frontend), the data storage and organization system (the backend), and an API that connects the frontend and backend. Many authors, including [Huang, Chung, and Chan](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-api-development/9781838983994/), use the analogy of a restaurant to describe an API. Customers place orders for the chefs to prepare, and waiters take the orders to the chefs, and return the food to the customers. In this analogy, customers are the frontend, issuing data requests; chefs are the backend, organizing and disseminating data; and waiters are the API, conducting the communication between the frontend and backend. Another analogy is the way our brains receive and react to sensory information. In this case, our senses comprise the API that connects the outside world to the internal workings of our brains.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs usually send and receive data in JSON (and sometimes XML) format. So being very comfortable with JSON formatted data is essential for working with APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why big organizations would want to share their data. Governments might be required by law to provide general access to public data. For profit companies like Google and Twitter share data to enable the development of third-party web applications that do useful things with the data. Twitter recently bought out [aiden.ai](https://www.aiden.ai/), a company that uses Twitter data to train AI models for marketing. (It's a brilliant strategy. By making their data available, Twitter encourages the creation of start-ups that are entirely dependent on Twitter data with no additional investment from Twitter. Then Twitter can use its data as leverage to buy-out the most successful start-ups for below market price.) Financial firms and other companies charge subscription fees for access to their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A carefully-constructed API also gives data providers certain powers over the data users. First, data providers might first require that users register for access to the API, surrendering their own personal information in exchange for access keys. Second, data providers can tightly control what and how much data they share. This power is called **encapsulation**. [Taina Bucher (2013)](http://computationalculture.net/objects-of-intense-feeling-the-case-of-the-twitter-api/) writes that encapulation also gives data providers the power to shape the narrative that a selection of shared data will tell:\n",
    "\n",
    "> While there is nothing wrong with using APIs to collect data, of course, researchers should be wary about letting any current obsessions with big data overshadow the fact that APIs are far from neutral tools. . . . APIs have ‘politics’, meaning that they can be seen as having ‘powerful consequences for the social activities that happen with them, and in the worlds imagined by them’.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when using an API, it's a good idea to think about what data are being shared, and what data are not being shared, why, and what that means for the analysis you are working on."

    "### Dealing with API Jargon\n",
    "Getting started with APIs can be confusing because of all the technical jargon that API documentation uses. But once you are familiar with this language, it gets a lot easier to use APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the analogy that helps us understand what an API does, an essential characteristic of systems that APIs serve is \"client-server separation\". That is, the system that interacts with the users and the system that interacts with the data must be separate and independent of each other. That way problems in one system do not cause problems in the other system, and either system can be replaced. Twitter's data server can interact with many different third-party user clients through its API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Client-server separation is one property an API needs to satisfy in order to meet the **Representational State Transfer (REST)** standards. An API that meets these standards is called a REST API (or \"RESTful\"). In addition to client-server separation, a REST API is stateless, which means that every request is independent of all other requests. That is, a request should produce the same output from the API regardless of whatever other requests have already been made. A REST API is also cacheable, which means that responses can be stored and retrieved when needed. If a new request exactly duplicates an old request, the API can use its stored cache from the old request to provide an instant response to the new request. A REST API should include a uniform user interface, so that all users see the same interface and interact with the API in the same way, and a REST API should include layers, so that distinct tasks are handled by many distinct sub-systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are designed to handle all transfers of data from the backend to the frontend, and vice versa. For that, there are basic functions (also called \"verbs\") that an API can execute. The two most common functions are GET, which pulls data from the backend, and POST, which stores new data in the backend. We can use the `requests` library in Python to issue both GET and POST commands. In addition, we can use PUT to replace a record in the backend with a new version, PATCH to make changes to an existing record, or DELETE to remove a record. These five verbs are part of the standard method for transfering information from servers to browsers over the internet, called the **hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)**, and responses from a REST API include [HTTP numeric status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes): 200 indicates a successful request, for example, and 404 means that the resource could not be found (maybe because there's a typo in the web address we entered). More generally, these functions are also called CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations."

    "### Reading API Documentation (Example: the NASA Image and Video Library)\n",
    "Most web-applications with an API include documentation to guide people who want to use the API. Knowing *how* to read the documentation, that is, knowing the jargon, is the most important skill for using an API. First, please note that like other kinds of documentation, some software authors take more care to produce good documentation than others. Still, all API documentation should share some universal characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most important piece of information to find in the documentation is the **root** and **endpoint**. The API root is a web-address for all resources that exist and are accessable through the API. The endpoint is a subdirectory where records of a specific type are stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each endpoint will usually have a separate section in the API documentation that contains a description of the kinds of data stored in this endpoint, a list of **parameters** to narrow down the data being requested, and (hopefully lots of) examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, if an API requires authentication, there should be instructions on how to register for an **access key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to generate a complete URL that points to the desired data by putting the root, endpoint, parameters, and access key together in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "*root* **/** *endpoint* **?** *parameters=value* **&** *key=value*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use as an example the API to access [NASA's Image and Video Library](https://images.nasa.gov/). The documentation for this API is available at https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf. This API does not require authentication, so we only need to find the root, endpoint, and parameters. Let's say that I want to find a photo of the moon. According to the documentation, the root is https://images-api.nasa.gov, and there are several endpoints including one dedicated to searches (`/search`). \n",
    "\n",
    "I scroll down to the section devoted to this endpoint and look at the parameters to see which ones will allow me to search for a photo of the moon. I can use the `q` parameter to enter free text as a search term, and the `media_type` parameter set equal to `image` to find a photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the complete URL for this API GET request is: https://images-api.nasa.gov/search?q=moon&media_type=image. Go ahead and click on this link. You will see a JSON file in which the metadata tells me there are 8626 hits in this search. Under the `data` header, the first result is an image entitled \"Nearside of the Moon\", which has a NASA ID code PIA12235.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I want to GET the URL for the JSON data related to this specific image. The endpoint to find a specific image is `/asset`. There's only one parameter, the NASA ID. Notice that the documentation lists this path as `asset/{nasa_id}` and NOT as `asset ? nasa_id = {nasa_id}`. That means that for this particular endpoint we simply enter a slash and the ID after the endpoint. So to see the JSON data stored for this image, the URL is https://images-api.nasa.gov/asset/PIA12235. This JSON contains the links to various image files. I can link to one of them to display it in this document:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA12235/PIA12235~small.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Some documentation also contain API schematics that visualize the endpoints and the interaction between the frontend and backend via the API. As an example, here's a schematic of an API for a project we are working on with [Code for Charlottesville](https://codeforcharlottesville.org), a local chapter of [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org) that I help to run. Our project involves building software for the agenices in town that help people with housing insecurity find a place to live. Our web application will allow people at different agencies share their data about available rental properties and landlords who are willing to rent to people with vouchers and who might have other complicated situations. Here's our API's schematic:\n",

    "Different API schematics vary in their presentation, but here the blue box represents the frontend interface that people at the housing agency will be using, the green boxes represent parts of the backend where different parts of the database will be stored, and the yellow blocks are notes that help our volunteers keep track of what each part of the schematic means. The arrows point either from the frontend to the backend, or from the backend to the frontend, and illustrate the data that is being sent from the origin to the destination. There are five endpoints. `/auth/register` stores the information about the users of the web-application and allows new users to input their information into the backend with a POST function. `/auth/login` allows registered users to POST their username and password. `/auth/status` allows users to GET their current login status, and `/auth/logout` allows users to GET confirmation that they've logged out. `/property` allows the housing agency users to GET information about available properties and landlords. Throughout the schematic, JWT stands for [Javascript web token](https://jwt.io/introduction/), a JSON file with extra security built in for secure web transfers. So get a list of properties, a user enters information to filter the search into the frontend, and this information is converted into a JSON file and passed to the `/property` endpoint of the backend, which sends back a JSON file containing a list of the relevant properties."

    "APIs like the NASA Image and Video Library and Wikipedia are entirely open. Anyone can access these APIs without registration and without having to supply credentials. But many APIs do make users first go through an authentication process to access the data. There are many reasons why a data provider might want to control access in this way. The data provider might just want information about who is using the API and for what purposes. Additionally, many APIs place restructions to limit how much one account can use the API. **Rate limits** set maximum numbers of total calls one account can make to the API in a specified period of time, possibly to protect the backend from crashing. Some APIs charge for access, or set tiers of accessibility at different price points. For whatever reason, if the data provider has a reason to keep track of who is using the API and how much they use it, the API will require an **access key**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain an access key, find the documentation for the API online. There should be clear instructions in the documentation about how to register and get an access key. Every data provider is different in terms of what information they ask for in exchange for the access key, so there's no general methodology beyond carefully following the instructions in the API documentation.\n",

In order to obtain a key, you will have to tell the Census your organization and email address, and you will have to agree to the Census's terms of service. After supplying that information, click on \"Submit Key Request\". You will receive an email after a few minutes containing your access key.\n",

    "Now that we have the access key stored in a Python variable we can pass it directly to the `params` parameter of `requests.get()` in a dictionary along with all of the other API parameters we specify. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose I want to download the population of every U.S. state by accessing the Census API through Python and then organize these data in a data frame. First I find and read the Census [API documentation](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/data/developers/api-user-guide/api-guide.pdf). The endpoint for population data is https://api.census.gov/data/2019/pep/charagegroups. I look at the documentation for this specific endpoint and find the list of parameters. There are three parameters I need to specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `get`: allows us to choose the features we wish to obtain from the API. Here let's get `GEO_ID` (the Census geocode for each state), and `POP` (the population).\n",

    "* `for`: allows us to specify the geographic entities we want included in the data. Typing `state:*` tells the API to provide data on all of the states.\n",

    "* `key`: this is where I enter my API access key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, while values of API parameters should be entered in quotes, `CensusKey` should be entered without quotes to ensure that the value of `CensusKey` and not the string \"CensusKey\" is entered in the dictionary. The dictionary is:"

These libraries (mostly) try to make the process of working with a complicated API much easier and more user friendly. We'll discuss two examples here.

    "APIs are a two-way system of data transfer. Not only can we pull data from APIs (a GET request), we can send data to remote servers using APIs (a POST request). For some applicaitons of APIs, we need to provide data to the server so that the server knows what data to send back to us. One example of this interchange is using the Google Maps API to get the latitude-longitude coordinates for an address, so that we can plot addresses on a map. The goal in this example is to get the coordinates for the address for \"60 Bonnycastle Dr Charlottesville, VA 22904\", otherwise known as the Dell, where the offices for the UVA School of Data Science are located."
