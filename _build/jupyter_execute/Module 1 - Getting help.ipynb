    "However, prior to launching into the data pipeline, we have to talk about the single most important skill for a data scientist: **how to get yourself unstuck**. That is, how to find the help you need to solve the inevitable problems, errors, and anomalies that will occur as you code. Remember, being a great data scientist does NOT mean doing everything perfectly. Great data scientists make mistakes just as often as anyone else. What sets them apart is their skill in using help resources to get to the **right answer, as quickly as possible**. In this notebook, we will discuss the various methods and resources at your disposal for finding help, and the *order* in which you should employ each resource. If you practice these skills for getting yourself unstuck, you won't have any trouble squashing all the bugs in your code.\n",

The documentation isn't as intuitive and easy to access as Google, but the answers that the official documentation will provide are guaranteed to be correct and specific to the functions you are trying to use, if you know what those functions are.

    "Usually, when you are stuck, it's because you ran some code that resulted in an error. Reading and understanding the error is the single most important and useful way to get yourself unstuck. These errors are not aesthetically pleasing, and they are written in technical language, but the *intention* of these error messages is to tell you exactly what went wrong. Many Python users skip reading the errors entirely, which is a shame because the error might indicate exactly the fastest way to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons why people skip over reading the errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The error appears in a big pink box with pea green and cyan text inside of it. It's pretty ugly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The first several lines of code are reserved for a function's **traceback**. The traceback is an attempt to isolate the particular line of code within a larger function that causes the error. However, the traceback is often very technical and not especially useful. After reading the first few lines of the traceback, most people give up on the entire error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the useful part of the error message occurs **at the bottom of the message**. The traceback is useful when developing new functions and debugging original software. But for the vast majority of the time, whenever you are using pre-programmed functions, only the bottom of the error message matters.\n",
    "\n",

    "Packages, modules, classes and functions in Python have built-in documentation that you can display directly in the console or in the output of a notebook. These built-in documentations are called **docstrings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"labwindow\"></a> Using a Console Window in JupyterLab\n",
    "The docstring should be the first place to look for help with specific, pre-built Python code. The problem is, calling up a docstring is very annoying in a Jupyter notebook. Ideally, you should be working with two windows side by side: one for the notebook or script that contains your code, and one for calling docstrings and running commands to view saved objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly suggest using JupyterLab (not just Jupyter), which is available from  Anaconda Navigator: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/. Please take a moment to download and install Anaconda Navigator, launch JupyterLab, and open this notebook in JupyterLab (by clicking on the file folder icon in the upper left corner of the screen, navigating to this file, and clicking on it) if you haven't already done so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, click **File**, then **New**, then **Console**. This will open a console window, in which you type commands one at a time into the bar at the bottom of the window, pressing SHIFT + ENTER/RETURN to execute the command. Find the tab at the top of the screen for the console, and click and drag it to the side of the screen. The notebook and console windows should now be side-by-side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, click on the console window, then click on **Kernel** at the top of the screen, and **Change Kernel...**. That brings up a \"Select Kernel\" menu. In the drop-down menu, choose the name of this notebook. That loads all the packages and objects that have been stored in the notebook's memory in the console. \n",

    "## <a name=\"online\"></a> How to Avoid Toxicity in Online Communities\n",
    "The next options involve becoming a **responsible, respectful** member of the worldwide community of Python users. Open-source platforms like Python and R depend on a community of volunteers who develop and maintain the tools that we use. All of these people are doing volunteer work for the common good, and that's a beautiful thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Python itself, Stack Overflow, Slack, the Freenode IRC, and mailing lists are online communities for Python users. But, like any online community, there's the potential for a toxic culture to destroy everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a toxic culture? How do you know one when you see one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Toxic cultures are more likely when\n",
    "\n",
    "* members are allowed to be anonymous (see [Lapidot-Lefler and Barak 2011](https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/health-jones-lapidotlefler-2012.pdf))\n",
    "* and members up-vote and down-vote and comment on each other's contributions (see [Massanari 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444815608807)).\n",
    "\n",
    "A culture can be either actively or passively toxic. Actively toxic communities are easy to identify. They encourage and are characterized by overt sexism, racism, bigotry, and calls for violence or other aggression against individuals. Most of the toxicity you will encounter in online programming and data science communities is not actively, but passively toxic. Passive toxicity is characterized by **gate-keeping**: Subtle behaviors that discourage people with less experience, or with some social anxiety, from participating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack overflow, IRCs, and mailing lists are notorious for passive toxic behavior. Passive toxicity is a bigger problem for us than active toxicity because actively toxic behavior is usually explicitly banned by codes of conduct, and individuals are often unaware of when they are acting in a passively toxic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of passive toxic behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Condescending language**: often people who are trying to earnestly answer a question unthinkingly use language that makes someone feel dumb for asking the question. Avoid using words such as \"obviously\", \"clearly\", \"actually\", \"just\", \"that should be easy\", \"google it\", \"read the manual\" (or \"RTFM\"). Here's an [example](https://twitter.com/aprilwensel/status/974859164747931650).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shaming**: attacking someone for asking a question by implying that the solution is easy and that someone is an idiot for not knowing it. Some examples: \"Learn to debug your own code\" and \"If you don't get this, you have no business being a data scientist.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Downvotes without explanation**: this can be both confusing and very upsetting to anyone, especially to people with less experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Virtue signaling**: implying that people are superior/inferior because of the language, software, or methods they use. For example: \"Real programmers don't use for loops\", \"You still use SAS?\", and so many memes:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localimages/rpythonmeme.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Authoritarianism**: Abusing people for failing to follow all of a community's rules for asking questions. For example, a comment that entirely ignores the content of the question but comments \"all questions must provide an example,\" or editing a user's post to remove where they wrote \"Hi everyone\" and \"thanks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overzealous curation**: Being very quick to tag a question as a \"duplicate\" without checking to see nuanced ways in which the question comes from a new situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of passive toxicity is that **many potential community members choose not to participate in the community** because their initial experiences made them feel ashamed, confused, or belittled. In addition, other potential new members observe these negative interactions involving other members, and choose to disengage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passive toxicity shrinks the community and makes it more homogeneous.** Across society, small, homogeneous communities are much more likely to exclude or discriminate against people based on sex, race, class, language} and other factors. And that leads to many ethical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Under no circumstances are you to contribute to an active or passive toxic culture in any community, online or otherwise.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Please keep the behaviors described here in mind when you engage in online communities, and avoid them. Don't be afraid to call out other people who behave in these ways."

    "This can be frightening. A lot of the time, people answering questions on Stack Overflow can be, well ... huge assholes that cause [real suffering](https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52). You might choose to avoid posting to Stack Overflow, so as not to support a website that has harbored abuse. That's completely fair. If you do post to Stack Overflow, you are likely to get some very useful responses if you follow some guidelines. There's [a strategy for getting good responses](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). You are more likely to get a good response if you follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Stack Overflow and Google to see if the question has already been answered.** Commenters dislike if the same question is asked repeatedly. This [poor guy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27885020/find-all-possible-combinations-of-letters-in-a-string-in-python) got roasted for posing a \"duplicate\" question. (An aside: *Why?* It's not like Stack Overflow is running out of space on their website.  There's an idea that Stack Overflow should be a central repository of knowledge. That means there should be one canonical answer to one question. But people often take this much too far. There are kinder ways to point to an existing answer.) So spend a significant amount of time digging through the internet. If there's something similar, but not quite what you need, you can say so in your post.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write a good title for your post.** A good title is specific about the problem, and also succinct:\n",
    "  * Bad: Problem with matplotlib (not specific)\n",
    "  * Also Bad: How do I place the labels of cars in a scatterplot of the weight and miles per gallon of cars onto the points in the scatterplot using matplotlob 3.3.1 on Python 3.7.4 on Mac OSX 10.14.5? (not succinct)\n",
    "  * Good: How to place labels on top of points in a matplotlib scatterplot?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Start the post with a paragraph describing the problem in more detail.** Some good things to include in this paragraph:\n",
    "  * The context of the problem -- how did you come across the problem? Describe the overall goal, not the just the buggy step.\n",
    "  * What you've already tried to solve the problem, and what happened.\n",
    "  * What is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n",
    "  * You can write the version of Python you are using, the version of the modules, and the operating system on your computer, in case the problem turns out to be specific to one of those\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If possible, **include code that reproduces the problem.** The code SHOULD NOT simply be the code in your script that isn't working. It needs to be able to work on someone else's computer. That means the code should not depend on any specific data files, and should not contain file addresses that refer to a location on your computer. Only use modules that are easy to get. If the code needs to run on data, can you use something pre-loaded in Python that everyone can access? (There are example datasets included with `scikit-learn`, for example.) Make the code as short as possible, and use comments to help people understand the code more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few additional things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be courteous and respectful. Respond to and thank everyone who comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Post a follow-up once the problem is solved so that people who come across this page in the future with the same problem know the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't ask people to write code for you. It's better to request help with code your provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't claim you found a bug in Python or in a module. It's a bit rude to the people who programmed the code (who don't get paid).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't ask about homework problems. ([Here's an example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23098699/calculate-the-mean-of-one-column-from-several-csv-files-in-r) of someone getting called out on this.)"
