    "## Introduction: Why It's So Important to Get Data Management Right\n",
    "### The Case of \"Genomic Signatures to Guide the Use of Chemotherapeutics\"\n",
    "In 2006, a study \"[Genomic Signatures to Guide the Use of Chemotherapeutics](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1491)\" was published in *Nature Medicine*. This study tackles the question of why chemotherapy works well for some cancer patients and less well for others. The authors claimed that they could predict whether and how treatments would work for a patient based on the sequence of chemicals in the DNA in the patient's cancer cells. This study got a lot of attention as a major breakthrough in cancer treatments. The hope was to use genomic data to tailor a treatment regime for individual patients that maximizes the likelihod that the treatment would be effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, as you can see on the journal's website for this article, the study has been retracted. The story of how this study came into question, and the damage it did before it was retracted, is described by Keith Baggerly in his talk \"[The Importance of Reproducibility in High-Throughput Biology: Case Studies in Forensic Bioinformatics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gYIs7uYbMo)\":"

    "The slides for this talk are available [here](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2009/BioC2009/talks/wrap_bioc_shareb.pdf). In short, Baggerly and his coauthor Kevin R. Coombes attempted to reproduce the findings in the Potti et al study, and they were unable to do so. There is a difference between reproduction and replication: reproducing a study involves using the same data used in the original study and writing code that yields the exact same results; replication involves repeating the study using new data. While replication is an essential practice for establishing the validity of a study, replication is also a higher standard than reproduction. If a study cannot be reproduced, then there must have been errors in the process collecting and cleaning the raw data that led to the publication of incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After deciding to replicate the Potti et al article, Baggerly and Coombes were able to get a copy of the raw data that were used in the study, but they did not find scripts or documentation that described the steps the original study took to clean the raw data. That's because there were no scripts and no documentation: the data were cleaned on the fly, probably with a point-and-click interface like Microsoft Excel, with no records of what was done to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without having good documentation available that explains how research was done, Baggerly and Coombes had to resort to \"forensics\". They started with the results and the raw data, and they inferred what the researchers must have done to obtain the reported results from the raw data. They were alerted to potential problems with the study when they tried to replicate the finding that there is a clear difference between two types of drugs, as shown in the graphic on slide 13 of Baggerly's slide deck. It should have been an easy finding to replicate. Instead they found significant overlap between the two drugs, as shown in the graphic on slide 14. They responded by trying to reproduce exactly what was done to the raw data in the original study to produce the first finding. After exhausting all possible *valid* data management steps, they started **making mistakes on purpose** to see if one of those mistakes would replicate the published results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Baggerly and Coombes found that the authors of the original paper made an error in which the codes for each reported gene were off by one. That is, the data for each gene is matched to the label for the gene whose data exists one row above. This error happened, according to Baggerly's best guess, because the software that the authors used requires the inputted data file to NOT have a header row for column names. But they seemed to just copy and paste the data, along with the header row. A second result that Baggerly says should \"bother you\" is that, on the heat map on slide 29, Baggery and Coombs matched 6 of the 7 heat maps despite the fact that they only matched the reported gene names for 3 of the 7 drugs. Therefore they would expect to reproduce the heat map for only these 3 drugs. Baggerly doesn't know why they matched the heat maps for the other 3 drugs despite the fact that they are using the wrong data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second discrepancy that raises a red flag for Baggerly is the plot showing the sensitive and resistant patients, as compared to the analogous plot from the paper that introduced the test dataset. The plot shows 13 sensitive and 11 resistant samples, whereas the paper that introduced the data shows 11 sensitive and 13 resistant samples. Baggery believes that the authors mixed up the 0 and 1, indicating sensitive and resistant, in the spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Baggerly and Coombes were only able to reproduce the findings in the Potti et al study by making \"small\" mistakes on purpose. When I say small, I mean that these sorts of errors can occur frequently when using a point-and-click interface for data management and a copy-and-paste method for transfering data. These errors also occur without informing the user of any errors. But in practice these small errors have profound impacts on the results of the study. If those results are taken seriously and applied outside of the specific study, these mistakes can do a lot of harm in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Potti et al study, while Baggerly and Coombes were investigating the paper,\n",
    "drug trials began at Duke University based on the results of the study. The treatment was administered to the patients with childhood leukemia. Because of the mistake that swaped the 0s and 1s, the treatment was administered to patients who are resistant to it, will not benefit from it, and may in fact be harmed by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baggerly and Coombes wrote a report detailing these inconsistencies and a few others - there's evidence that some samples were reused 2, 3, or 4 times, and 4 genes appear in the results despite the fact that they are not included in the test data - and sent the report to *Nature Medicine*. Their report caused Duke to stop the clinical trials of these drugs pending an investigation. But a short while later the trials were restarted, with the statement that the investigation had \"strengthened confidence in this approach.\" The investigators refused to share their findings. Baggery and Coombs has to issue a freedom of informatiom act (FOIA) request to see the results of the investigation, only to find that no mention was made of the problematic drugs. Writing directly to Duke yielded no response. They had to get many prominent biostatisticians to sign a joint letter of concern. The letter got some attention in the media, but mostly because it was revealed that the principal investigator of the flawed studies lied on his CV about being a Rhodes scholar! Only after the letter generated a serious amount of negative media attention for Duke did the trials get suspended."

    "### The Reproducible Research Movement\n",
    "There are four lessons we can learn from that Baggerly and Coombes's work to reassess the Potti et al. First, mistakes at the data management stage happen all the time, and when the environment uses a point-and-click interface the errors are easier to miss because of a lack of a sufficient error system. Second, small errors can have big effects. It's easy to confuse categories when they are labeled with arbitrary numbers instead of words, but if that confusion results in mixing up the treatment and control groups then every effect reported in the study will have the incorrect sign, and all of the conclusions we draw will be the exact opposite of the truth. Third, it is common for people who do work with data to fail to keep records of their code and the steps they used to manipulate the raw data prior to an analysis, and without documentation, it can be extremely difficult to impossible to catch errors in the data management process. Fourth, while most scientists are hopefully open to seeing and admitting their mistakes, there aren't a lot of incentives in academia and other fields to make the research stream more transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"[The Reproducible Research Movement in Statistics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.667.6492)\", Victoria Stodden describes the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The research system must offer rewards for reproducible research at every level from departmental decisions to grant funding and journal publication, incorporating notions of code and data sharing into institutional \n",
    "promotion and hiring and grant proposal review. The current academic research system places the primary emphasis on publication and little on reproducibility. This has the effect of penalizing those researchers that produce reproducible computational research. Software development has been characterized as support of science rather than doing real science. The result is that scientists are discouraged from spending time writing, testing, or releasing code. With the ever-increasing pervasiveness of computation and software across the research landscape, such attitudes and practices must change (p.1069-1070).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these issues, the last decade has seen a remarkable cultural shift in fields that use data towards making data management easier and more transparent. These efforts are often called part of the \"reproducible research movement\". The movement involves two efforts: first, a greater push to develop software that makes it easier to clean data and to share and communicate code; second, a drive to change standards of best practice in fields that use data. Since Victoria Stodden's article in 2013, data science has incorporated both parts of the reproducible research movement. In Python, the `pandas` package makes it much easier to clean data using code that is intuitive and relatively easy to follow, and Jupyter notebooks combine code, results, and text that explains the code in one document. Modern data science requires practioners to share or be ready to share their code, often in a notebook."

    "### The Origin of `pandas`\n",
    "The `pandas` package in Python is written and maintained by Wes McKinney, who also wrote [Python for Data Analysis](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/). On the `pandas` [team page](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/team.html), under governance, McKinney is listed as the `pandas` \"[Benevolent Dictator for Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)\". The phrase \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" is given to leaders of important open-source projects, and originated with Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "McKinney developed `pandas` in 2008 and first released the project publicly in 2009. Though not explicitly presented as a contribution to the reproducible research movement, the goal of `pandas` was to replace existing tools for data manipulation that had led to major mistakes in research, as was the case for the Potti et al article. According to this [profile of Wes McKinney](https://qz.com/1126615/the-story-of-the-most-important-tool-in-data-science/) in Quartz Magazine, `pandas` \"makes it so that data analysis tasks that would have taken 50 complex lines of code in the past now only take 5 simple lines, because McKinney already did the heavy lifting.\" Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python was missing some key features that would make it a good language for data analysis. For example, it was challenging to import CSV files (one of the most common formats for storing datasets). It also didn’t have an intuitive way of dealing with spreadsheet-like datasets with rows and columns, or a simple way to create a new column based on existing columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pandas addressed these problems. David Robinson, a data scientist at Stack Overflow, explained the importance of it in technical terms. “The idea of treating in memory data like you would a SQL table is incredibly powerful,” he says. “By introducing the ‘DataFrame,’ Pandas made it possible to do intuitive analysis and exploration in Python that wasn’t possible in other languages like Java. And is still not possible.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, `pandas`, like SQL, is a declarative language, not a procedural one. Simple functions and methods in `pandas` call underlying imperative code that performs the requested action by operating on vectors, matrices, and arrays. `pandas` as much as possible uses `numpy` functions to perform actions as quickly as possible (by using `numpy`'s [vectorized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization_(mathematics)) code). In short, the motivation for the development of `pandas` is to make data manipulation as straightforward as possible and for those functions to run as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` is an extremely popular package for data science, and the Quartz article asserts that much of the growth in popularity that Python has experienced on Stack Overflow can be attibuted to `pandas`. While `pandas` is currently the [34th most frequently downloaded Python package](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/), it is certainly one of the most frequently downloaded for data science applications in Python."

    "### Tidy Data\n",
    "In Module 7, we discussed the concept of Tidy Data as described by Hadley Wickham, founder of RStudio and creator of the `tidyverse` packages in R, in the article \"[Tidy Data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)\". Tidy Data is an organizational schema for data that makes most kinds of data analysis possible. To qualify as tidy, data must follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Each [feature] forms a column.\n",
    "> 2. Each observation forms a row.\n",
    "> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table (p. 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, even when data are arranged in a single table in which records are rows, features are columns, and all records are of like units, there are many steps a researcher should take to manipulate the data to make a dataframe easier to work with. Hadley Wickham defines four essential \"verbs\" of data manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Filter: subsetting or removing observations based on some condition.\n",
    "> * Transform: adding or modifying variables. These modifications can involve either a single variable (e.g., log-transformation), or multiple variables (e.g., computing density from weight and volume).\n",
    "> * Aggregate: collapsing multiple values into a single value (e.g., by summing or taking means).\n",
    "> * Sort: changing the order of observations (p. 13).\n",
    "\n",
    "This philosophy of data management is built into the `tidyverse` packages for R, but it also forms a guiding principle for data manipulation with `pandas` because `pandas` includes tools to accomplish all of these tasks. In fact, Hadley Wickham and Wes McKinney are currently working together on a project called [https://ursalabs.org/](https://ursalabs.org/), which aims to bridge the R-Python divide and to develop platform-independent data science tools."

    "## Example: The American National Election Study\n",
    "The [American National Election Study](https://electionstudies.org) (ANES) is a massive public opinion survey conducted after every national election. It is one of the greatest sources of data available about the voting population of the United States. It contains far more information than a typical public opinion poll. Iterations of the survey contain thousands of features from thousands of respondents, and examines people's attitudes on the election, the candidates, the parties, it collects massive amounts of demographic information and other characteristics from voters, and it records people's opinions on a myriad of political and social issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to each election the ANES conducts a \"pilot study\" that asks many of the questions that will be asked on the post-election survey. The idea is to capture a snapshot of the American electorate prior to the election and to get a sense of how the survey instrument is working so that adjustments can be made in time. Here we will work with the [2019 ANES pilot data](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2019-pilot-study/). To understand the features and the values used to code responses, the data have an associated [questionnaire](https://electionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anes_pilot_2019_questionnaire.pdf) and [codebook](https://electionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anes_pilot_2019_userguidecodebook.pdf).

Many of the features have names that we might want to change to be more descriptive, and use arbitrary numeric codes to stand in for categories. If we look at the codebook, we will also see that negative numbers in the cells represent missing datapoints, and unless we take steps to replace these datapoints they will be read as valid numeric data.

To specify more than one row or more than one column, these elements can be lists or can use `:` to express a range. For example, to extract rows 1 through 4 (remembering that the first row is row 0 and tha the second number in the range is excluded) and columns 12 through 14, we can type:"

    "A second approach to selecting columns is technically more complicated, but offers a great deal more control over which columns are included in the edited data and which columns are not. This approach involves using a comprehension loop on the `.columns` attribute to extract the elements of this list that match given patterns. The individual elements of `.columns` are strings on which `.startswith()`, `.endswith()`, and `.contains()` apply. The comprehension loop allows us to use these methods in logical statements that determine whether each element is included or excluded in the new list.\n",

I do not recommend that approach, however, because it requires an entry for every column and it requires these names to be written in exactly the same order as the existing columns, or else the data will be corrupted. Instead, use the `.rename()` method. This method does not require us to think about the left-to-right order of the columns, and it allows us to rename only a few columns without worrying about the ones we do not want to rename. To use this method, specify two parameters: first a dictionary that contains elements in the form of `'oldname':'newname'`, and second `axis='columns'` or `axis=1` to work with columns. \n",

Carefully replacing the numbers with text will keep us from potentially confusing which number stands for which category.

Replacing the numeric codes with text for the categorical labels is a two step process:\n",

    "### Dealing With Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "After recoding, we are left with quite a few missing values in the data. To generate a logical matrix that indicates for every cell whether the datapoint is missing or not, we can use `anes_clean.isnull()`. To delete every row that has even one missing value, we can use `anes_clean.dropna()`. That's a heavy-handed treatment of missing data, however, that can severely reduce sample size and can lead to biases in analytical results of datapoints are missing not at random. There are much better treatments for missing data, called **imputation** methods. Many methods for missing data imputation are implemented in the [scikit-learn package](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "One application of the `isnull()` method is to replace missing values with known values if those values are available elsewhere. For example, the ANES asked two versions of the feeling thermometer for immigrants. A respondent is only asked one of the two questions, so one of `ftimmig1` and `ftimmig2` is missing:"

    "### Why Recoding Categorical Data is Dangerous\n",
    "Before we move on to another topic, there are three reasons why **recoding categorical data is one of the most dangerous tasks in data manipulation**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is very easy here to mistakenly place the wrong labels on categories. If we make an error here, Python will not inform us of the error. It is important to read the codebook carefully and make certain that the categories are labeled correctly. For example, suppose I want to study the effect of attending a political protest on voters' preferences and beliefs. The ANES data contains a feature that reports whether or not each individual has attended a political protest in the last year. The value 1 means that the person attended a protest, and the value 2 means that the person did not attend a protest. If we mix up these labels, then any analysis that uses the protest feature will not only be wrong - it will generate results that are exactly the opposite of the truth. Suppose that people who attend a protest are 20% more likely to vote in the upcoming election than people who have not attended a protest. If we mislabel the protest categories, the result would suggest that people who attend a protest are 20% *less* likely to vote, and this result will have the same level of uncertainty as the truth. Imagine if these data came from a drug trial: if we mislabel the treatment and control groups, we would conclude that a drug that benefits patients harms those patients, or vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we have an opportunity to change the data in significant ways while recoding categories. These changes might be the correct ones to make, but it is important to be extremely transparent with all of the changes as they can impact the results of any subsequent analysis. For example, the party identification feature in the ANES data is coded as\n",
    "* 1 - Strong Democrat\n",
    "* 2 - Not very strong Democrat\n",
    "* 3 - Independent, closer to Democrats\n",
    "* 4 - Independent\n",
    "* 5 - Independent, closer to Republicans\n",
    "* 6 - Not very strong Republican\n",
    "* 7 - Strong Republican\n",
    "\n",
    "For my purposes I choose to recode this feature as having three categories, Democrat, Republican, and independent. But to do so, I have to choose how exactly to collapse categories. I choose to combine \"Strong Democrat\", \"Not very strong Democrat\", and \"Independent, closer to Democrats\" into a category named \"Democrat\", and \"Strong Republican\", \"Not very strong Republican\", and \"Independent, closer to Republicans\" into a category named \"Republican\". I leave \"Independent\" as it is. There is not an unambiguously correct way to perform this recoding: maybe the two leaning-independent categories should be grouped within \"Independent\" instead. I recode the feature in this way because I theorize that many people in the survey will declare themselves to be independent, but really behave more like Democrats or Republicans. Even though I have a reason for choosing my coding scheme, it is a decision that can change any analysis that uses party identification. Maybe the results would be very different if we expanded the independent category. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, if the categories for a feature can be aligned in a meaningful order, we have a choice about whether to treat this feature as categorical or as numeric. If we treat the feature as categorical, then we label each number. That's useful especially for generating visualizations in which this feature comprises an axis. If we treat the feature as numeric, we leave the numbers as they are (while ensuring that the categories are in the right order). That's useful if we want to report statistics like the mean and variance, and we believe that these statistics have meaning for the ordered scale. For features like `universal_income` in the ANES data, the categories represent degrees of support for a policy. If we label the categories, we see clearly how many people adopt each nuanced position on the spectrum between support and non-support. If we leave the categories as numbers, we can report the average level of support on the 7-point scale. Whether to label the categories of an ordered categorical feature or leave them as numeric should therefore depend on the problems the feature will be applied to."

    "## Sorting Rows\n",
    "Sorting is a largely cosmetic thing to do because most analyses don't use the ordering of the rows to generate results. That said, especially in the early data cleaning stages of an analysis, it can be very useful to sort the rows of a dataframe according to the values in one or more columns, especially if the data contain an ID with a clear alphabetic or numeric order, like country names or time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sort, use the `.sort_values()` method. Within the method, use the `by` argument to specify the column you want to sort by. By default, sorting is done in ascending order for numeric features and in alphabetical order for string features, To save the sorting, either write `inplace=True` or re-assign the sorted dataframe to the same variable. `.sort_values()` will always put rows that have missing values for the sorting column at the bottom of the dataframe. \n",

    "## Filtering Rows\n",
    "Filtering is the task of keeping or deleting rows based on a logical condition. Prior to discussing the code for filtering, let's review logical operators. Every logical statement returns a value of `True` or `False` in Python, and these statements are useful for keeping rows for which a condition is `True` and deleting rows for which a condition is `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has the following logical operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `==` \"is equal to\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* `!=` \"is not equal to\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* `>` \"is greater than\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* `>=` \"is greater than or equal to\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<` \"is less than\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<=` \"is less than or equal to\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* `in` \"is in the list\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* `not in` \"is not in the list\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It also has the following symbols to *connect* logical statements to build more complicated statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `&` \"and\" (both conditions must be true for the whole statement to be true)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `|` \"or\" (at least one of the conditiona must be true for the whole statement to be true)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `not` turns `True` results to `False`, and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "* `(` and `)` (parentheses work with logic the way they do with algebra -- consider this part of the statement first)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to filter the rows in a dataframe based on a logical condition, but the best method is `.query()` because of its notational ease and because it allows **chaining**: that is, specifying many logical conditions with repeated calls to `.query()`. Chaining is another way to express \"and\" in a combined logical statement. To use `.query()`, type it as a method applied to the dataframe in question, and put the logical condition in double quotes - that allows us to use single quotes within the query. For example, to see just the Joe Biden voters, type:"

We can either create a new column that contains these differences, or we can replace an existing column with this new column. To create a new column called `partisanship`, we can type:"

We can calculate `age` from `birthyr` and we can also generate a column containing the square of age (which is useful to place a curvilinear effect into a linear regression model): "

To convert the column's values to strings type `.astype('str')`, to convert the column's values to integers type `.astype('int')`, and to convert the column's values to floats type `.astype('float')`. `pandas` also recognizes a categorical data type, and to convert a column to categorical type `.astype('category')`. As an example, let's convert the Joe Biden thermometer scores to each data type:"

In `pandas`, data aggregation follows a **split-apply-combine** approach. First, the data are split into subsets for every group in the grouping column. Then a function, such as the mean, is applied to the same columns in each subset and each subset is compressed to have just one row. Then the subsets are combined into the final resulting dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for aggregating a dataframe is\n",
    "```\n",
    "df.groupby('groupcolumn').aggfunctions.sort_values()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands to aggregate dataframes can get confusing very quickly. It helps to break down the syntax for data aggregation into parts for each method listed in the syntax. First, `df` is the name of the dataframe we want to compress. Second, `.groupby('groupcolumn')` specifies the column whose categories will define the rows of the aggregated dataframe. If more than one column defines these groups (examples below), then the syntax becomes `.groupby(['groupcolumn1', 'groupcolumn2'])`. Third, `.aggfunctions` defines how other columns in the data can be included and summarized in the aggregated data. Finally, `.sort_values()` is optional, but often helps to generate a better presentation for the aggregated data table.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's collapse the ANES data by the candidates that people report they will vote for. We start with `anes_clean` and set the grouping variable with `.groupby('vote')`. We apply the `.size()` function, which reports the number of rows in each group, and we use `.sort_values(ascending=False)` to list these counts from biggest to smallest (no `by` argument is needed because there is only one column in the aggregated data). In all, this command provides a tally of people's voting intentions as of December 2019:\n"

    "To use aggregation functions other than `.size()`, the best option is to use the `.agg()` method instead. `.agg()` takes a dictionary as its argument, and this dictionary should contain the names of the columns we want to summarize, as keys, and the functions we want to use to collapse these columns, as values. For example, we can construct a table in which the rows are the voting groups, and the columns contain the mean feeling thermometers for Trump, Biden, immigrants, and journalists:"
