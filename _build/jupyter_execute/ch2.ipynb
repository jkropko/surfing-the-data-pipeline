    "## Introduction: Please don’t bend, fold, spindle or mutilate me\n",
    "\"['Do Not Fold, Spindle or Mutilate': A Cultural  History of the Punch Card](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~harold/Courses/Old/CS1400.W15/Diary/Lubar1992.pdf)\" by Steven Lubar details the earliest method of data storage and transference. Punch cards were first used by the U.S. government to tabulate the 1890 census. Before World War 1, punch cards started being used by the military, the railroads, and insurance companies to store data. In the 1930s, punch cards were used by the New Deal agencies, and by the 1940s punch cards were widespread throughout American society.\n",

    "\n",
    "Punchcards predated computers, which is to say that data storage and transference predates computers. These early uses of punchcards employed [data tabulation machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabulating_machine) capable of counting the number of times particular holes have been punched in a series of cards, fed into the machine one at a time. The tabulation machine used for counting the 1890 census was developed by a company that later became IBM. \n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localimages/punchcard2.jpg\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "When punchcards became widely used, they were printed with a universal warning: \"don’t bend, fold, spindle or mutilate\", which became a cultural meme that long outlived the use of punchcards. In the 1960s, punchcards and the slogan \"don’t bend, fold, spindle or mutilate\" became symbols of alienation and technocratic oppression used by campus protests and many countercultural movements:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The depersonalization of the punch-card era found its catch phrase in the words on the cards; its ubiquity gave it instant familiarity. One observer of the period wrote that  marijuana, the 60s escape from the rigors of the real world, let you see \"the strangeness of real unfolded-unspindled-unmutilated life\" (Gitlan 202). \"Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate\" became shorthand for a whole realm of  countercultural experience. The ecological movement of the early 1970s, a child of the 1960s counterculture, picked up on it too: a popular poster for Earth Day 1970 showed a picture of the Earth taken from space with the legend  \"Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate\" (Lubar 1992, p. 48). \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in the 1950s it became possible to run more advanced statistical analyses, such as linear regression, using [mainframe computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer) with punchcard inputs. Many of my professors in grad school had stories about trekking across campus at 3am, the only time they could get access to the computer, to the building with the giant, noisy computer in the basement. They would carry a stack of punchcards, trying hard not to trip or slip on ice because dropping the punchcards would mean hours of work to get them back into a specific order. Finally, while inputting the cards, inevitably one would get jammed, which meant alerting the surly technician on call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two technological advances together made punchcards obsolete. First, in the late 1970s and through the 1980s, it became possible to store data directly on a computer hard drive or a floppy disk, which led to the creation of electronic data files such as CSV. Second, the internet made it possible to transfer data electronically, which led to APIs, HTML, and remote databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today there are several common ways to access electronic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. People can share individual data files through websites, email, or hard storage. These files are often in ASCII format, but can be stored in other (sometimes proprietary) formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Through an application programming interface (API): a specific system that connects clients to web servers and allows the transfer of data, often formatted in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Through raw HTML that can be converted into tabular data through web-scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Through a local or remote relational database - a collection of many individual datasets - managed using SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "For modern data science, it's important to be very comfortable working with all of these methods of sharing data. We will go over individual data files in this module, and the other methods in the following modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I demonstrate how to load CSV files with various messy properties that have to be addressed when loading the data into Python. I also demonstrate how to look at a dataframe once it's loaded to search for problems, and how to load fixed width, Excel, SAS, Stata, and SPSS data files. All of the data for these examples are available on this [GitHub page](https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/tree/master/localdata).\n",

    "## Changing the Working Directory\n",
    "Before we go over the functions to load and save data files, it is useful to set the working directory at the start of your script or notebook. This **sets the default folder where Python opens and saves files**. If all of your files are in the same folder, setting the working directory means you don't have to write out the paths each time you load or save a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the `os` package.\n",
    "* Type the folder's address into `os.chdir(\"`*folder*`\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "To check on the path Python is currently using as a default, type `os.getcwd()` into the console. If you want to change the working directory back after you've run the relevant code, save your old path as an object to begin your notebook, and change the path back to the old path to end your notebook, like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "oldpath = os.getcwd()\n",
    "os.chdir(\"folder\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#(Your code goes here)\n",
    "\n",
    "os.chdir(oldpath)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I want this notebook to work on anyone's environment, I will only work with files that are accessable through the web. But make sure to change the working directory in your own notebooks for working with local data files.\n",

    "## Text-Based Data Files\n",
    "When data could first be stored on harddrives and disks, space was very limited. In order to store data as efficiently as possible, universal standards for which symbols would be considered valid data were adopted. These standards, which are still in use today, are called [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII):\n",
    "\n",
    "**ASCII** - (pronounced \"As-Key\") American Standard Code for Information Interchange:\n",
    "* 128 characters are considered to be \"legal\" in data files.\n",
    "* ASCII files are plain text files. They may be messy, and not immediately ready for use in analyses, but we have methods to load and clean ASCII data.\n",
    "* ASCII files are designed to be as small and as universally portable as possible.\n",
    "* Data points are usually delimited by commas, spaces, or tabs, or might require a data dictionary to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common ASCII format is comma-separated values (CSV), in which individual data points are separated by commas. A CSV file is a plain text file that can be opened with Notepad on Windows or with TextEdit on Mac. Each row in the data appears on a new row in the text file, but the columns do not necessarily align - instead the commas represent new columns, so that the fourth and fifth commas on a line surround the fifth column in the data, for example. If the column names are included in the data, they will be listed on the first line. If you open a CSV file in a plain text editor, it will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localimages/ascii1.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "On many computers with Microsoft Office installed, CSV files are opened by default in Microsoft Excel. Excel might be a convenient tool for aligning the columns and visualizing the data in a spreadsheet, but please note that the `.csv` filetype is a universal and lightweight format that can be opened in any programming environment. It is not specific to Microsoft:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localimages/butterfly.jpg\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a CSV, the comma is called the delimiter: the character that separates datapoints. Another frequently used delimiter is the tab. Here's the same data in tab-separated format:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localimages/tsv.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations the data are stored in a way that minimizes the memory needed to contain the data. In that case, we can do away with the delimiter altogether and instead fixing particular spaces on each line to represent specific columns. We can save further space by also removing the column names from the file. This format is called a fixed-width data file, and in a plain text editor it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localimages/fixedwidth.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this file contains no information to help us understand what the columns are or where they begin or end. Fixed-width files always come with a data dictionary that contains this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will show examples of how to work with tab-separated, fixed-width, and other files below. But first, to load a standard CSV file with no issues that need to be fixed, use the `pd.read_csv()` function. The first argument of `pd.read_csv()` is `filepath_or_buffer`, and can be one of three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The full file address and file name of the data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Just the file name of the data file if you've already set the working directory to the folder where the file exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The URL of a data file that's accessible online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a data file is loaded into Python with `pd.read_csv()`, it is called a `DataFrame`.\n",

    "### Displaying the Data Type of Each Column\n",
    "All data that is stored in Python's memory is assigned a type that controls how various functions operate by default on that data. For example, the `.describe()` method (that I discuss in the next section) provides means and other summary statistics for numeric data, and frequencies for text data. If you intend to perform mathematical operations on a column in a data frame, such as by including the column in a regression model, it is important to first confirm that the column is read with an appropriate data type. The most common data types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `int64`: integer numbers with up to 64 digits\n",
    "* `float64`: numbers with decimals with up to 64 total digits\n",
    "* `object`: text, or numeric data coded as text\n",
    "* `bool`: only `True` or `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `.dtypes` attribute to display the data types of every column. Because this information is stored in a table, we need to turn off the default limit on the number of rows displayed to see all of the columns' data types:"

But the maximum value is 998 for a feature which by design should be no larger than 100. It turns out that throughout the data 998 is one of a few numeric codes that indicates a nonresponse.

    "There are many ways that text-based data files can be arranged that cause problems for loading the data into Python and for using the data for analyses. Please note that not every problem needs to be solved in the loading step: the entire `pandas` library exists for cleaning data once it is loaded into Python's memory. But some problems are more efficiently solved as we load the file. Here we will discuss some common problems and strategies for solving them while loading the data. \n",

    "The `pd.read_csv()` function assumes that the column names are listed on the first line of the data file, unless the `header` parameter is used, in which it assumes the column names are on the first line after the header. But if the data do not contain a row of column names then Python will use the first line of valid data as the column names. I created a version of the ANES data with the column names deleted.

    "### Fixed-width Files\n",
    "A fixed-width file contains no delimiters. Instead, it aligns all of the data for one variable in the same position on each row. These files generally do not store variable names, and might use less memory than CSV. But that makes the data impossible to parse without an external list of where each variable is stored. The first and most important step is to get this list. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, I pulled data from a public opinion survey conducted by the National Journal a few years ago. The data are available from the [Roper Center for Public Opinion Research](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/), and the raw data are in fixed-width format. The codebook is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localdata/njcc_codebook.pdf), take a look. The features are listed on page 3, along with their column positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading a fixed-width file is a two step process. First, we use the codebook to create lists of the variable names, and either the width of each variable (how many columns each variable takes up), or the starting and ending position. Here we save both lists, although you will only need one of these two lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the starting and ending position of each variable, we create a list of length 2 for each variable, where the first element is the column the previous variable ends on (or 0 for the first variable) and the second element is the column the current variable ends on. For example, if a variable occupies columns 34, 35, and 36, its list of length 2 is [33,36]. Then we store the lists-of-2 in a list-of-lists."

    "## Loading Other Kinds of Electronic Data Files\n",
    "CSV, ASCII, and other kinds of plain text files are very common in fields that primarily use open-source programming environments like Python and R, as these file types are lightweight and universal. But there are many more people out there who work in fields that use specific, proprietary data analysis software. It can be a real challenge to load a specific file format in a context outside of its native software environment. There are specialized software that only exist to transfer proprietary data from one environment to another. One package is Stat/Transfer, which can easily convert data from Stata to SAS to SPSS to Excel for [$129 a year for academic users](https://stattransfer.com/ordering/academic/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Stata, SAS, SPSS, Excel, or another program, or if you are working with someone who uses that software, and you want to transfer data to Python, the easiest approach is to save the working data as a CSV file and then load it into Python with `pd.read_csv()`. All of those software packages have the functionality to save data as CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't help you if you are dealing with an SPSS file and you do not have access to SPSS. Fortunately, Python has functions to load data from pretty much every software environment. Here's a rundown of these functions."

    "### Loading Excel Files\n",
    "There are a few methods for loading Excel files in Python but a great function is the `pd.read_excel()` function in `pandas`. One big way that Excel files differ from other data formats is the use of sheets in the same document. The main challenge in loading an Excel file in Python is dealing with the sheets. \n",
    "\n",
    "I've saved an Excel file on [GitHub](https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localdata/NBA-Team-Sample-BoxScore-Dataset.xlsx) that contains information about NBA teams during the 2018-2019 season. This Excel document contains four sheets, named \"NBA-TEAM-SAMPLE\", \"METADATA\", \"TEAMS\", and \"CONVERT DATE FORMAT\". All four sheets have visual formatting. I want to load the \"TEAMS\" sheet without carrying forward any code that refers to the visual appearance of this sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument of `pd.read_excel()` is the path, as with pd.read_csv(), and it can take a URL. The second argument is sheet_name. If the Excel file has sheets with names, you can type the name of the sheet here. Or type a number: 0 refers to the first sheet, 1 to the second, etc. This function loads the data directly to a data frame, and ignores other graphical elements of Excel sheets, such as shading particular cells or using fonts."

    "SPSS files have the file extension `.sav`, and can be loaded with `pd.read_spss()` in the same way. One issue (at the time this notebook was written) is that the `pd.read_spss()` function only accepts local files, and not files from URLs. I saved data from a public opinion survey on [GitHub](https://github.com/jkropko/DS-6001/raw/master/localdata/survey.sav). If you want to try loading it into Python, download the file and move it to the folder where you've set your working directory (or type out the whole file path in the following code), and type:\n",

    "Suppose we've done all the steps needed to clean and manage the data. We might want to save a clean version of the data in a CSV or other ASCII file on our local disk space. We can do so by applying the `.to_csv()` method to the `anes` data frame. The first argument is the filename with whatever extension we want for the saved file. As with `pd.read_csv()`, we can also specify the `sep` parameter to choose a delimiter for the text-based data file we are creating. Let's save the ANES dataframe as \"anes_cleaned.csv\" in our working directory:"
