    "## Introduction: Douglas Crockford's JSON Saga\n",
    "[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**, and it is one of the most frequently used data formats for transferring data over the Internet. If you will be using a web-based data transfer system, such as an API (more on that in the next module), you will be dealing with data in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON data format is attributed to Douglas Crockford, a Javascript architect at Yahoo!, although in his words: \"I discovered JSON. I do not claim to have invented JSON, because it already existed in nature. What I did was I found it, I named it, I described how it was useful.\" Here's an excellent talk by Douglas Crockford in which he describes the origin of JSON and the early struggles to create a universal and lightweight language for data transference. The talk is about 50 minutes long, but it is worth watching if you have the time."

    "Crockford and his collaborators developed JSON in 2001 with the objective of creating a language to store, display, and transfer in a way that works on every browser. In other words, the whole point of JSON is to be **universal**, so that the data are readable no matter the browser or environment. JSON is also designed to be as **lightweight** as possible: that is, JSON code is as compact as possible. JSON sacrificies features that expand the functionality of the language, such as comments, processing instructions, or attributes, in order to use the minimal amount of code. The lightweight construction of JSON makes [JSON code much faster than alternative data interchange languages like XML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12346349/why-is-json-more-lightweight-than-xml). It also helps achieve the goal of universality: a lightweight language works within existing infrastructures with no additional software or extraneous code because every programming language understands data in some form, and a minimalist data structure works with every language's idea of what data should be. In Crockford's words:"

    "> One of the key design goals behind JSON was minimalism. My idea was that the less we have to agree on in order to inter-operate, the more likely we're going to be able to inter-operate well. If the interfaces are really simple, we can easily connect, and if the interfaces are really complicated, the likelihood that something's going to go wrong goes way, way up. So I endeavored to make JSON as simple as possible."

    "### Looping Across Records to Extract Datapoints\n",
    "While JSON is a well-organized and flexible data format that preserves a lot of the meaningful context of the data, most analytical tools and statistical models can only operate on tabular data. So a major challenge with JSON data is converting the data to a tabular format to be saved in a data frame. One method is to construct a loop across records to extract desired elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we discuss this method, I do not recommend using this approach in general. Loops are usually slow, and it is much faster to perform these kinds of operations by **vectorizing** code. [Vectorizing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1422149/what-is-vectorization#1422181) refers to the ability of a programming language to operate on an entire vector of data and work on several elements simultaneously, rather than on each element one at a time. Vectorization is the specialty of the `numpy` library, and most functions in `pandas` are vectorized as well. I suggest using `pd.read_json()` and `pd.json_normalize()` to convert JSON data to a data frame as they will be several orders of magnitude faster for converting the entire JSON to a data frame. Looping make sense only when we need to extract a small number of features from JSON data with a large feature set, because with the loop we directly call the features we want and we can avoid having to work with features we don't need.\n",

    "1. Use `requests.get()` to download the raw JSON data (unless you have another way of acquiring the raw data)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `json.loads()` on the `.text` attribute of the output from step 1 to register the data as a list in Python\n",

    "3. Look at the data using a web-browser, or using the text that appears when the JSON object is called in Python, to decide on the path that is necessary to find the records\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the `pd.json_normalize()` function on the list that is the output of step 2. But within this function, use the `record_path` parameter and set it equal to a list with the keys, in order, that lead to the record\n",

    "5. Optionally, use the `meta` and `meta_prefix` parameters in `pd.json_normalize()` to store the metadata in the dataframe\n",

    "For example, we can access a JSON file for the top 25 top posts at the moment on [Reddit's r/popular page](https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/) here: http://www.reddit.com/r/popular/top.json. If our goal is to construct a data frame with 25 rows, one for each post, we must find the path that leads to these data. Looking at the web-browser, the top-level has two keys: \"kind\" and \"data\". \"kind\" is simply metadata telling us that this file contains listings, and the data live in \"data\". Within this branch, there are four more metadata branches, \"modhash\", \"dist\", \"before\", and \"after\", and the data we need exist within \"children\". So the path we need is `[\"data\", \"children\"]`. The code to construct the data frame we need is:"

    "Please note: we added `headers = {'User-agent': 'DS6001'}` to the `requests.get()` function. When we use `requests.get()`, we are accessing an API: a web-based interface for transferring data, usually in the form of JSON files. We will cover APIs in the next module. Most APIs, including Reddit's, include some security to keep any one user from overusing the API and causing it to crash. For Reddit, we only need to provide a unique \"[User-agent](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/3qbll8/429_too_many_requests/)\", which is an ID that Reddit uses to keep track of how much we are using the API. If two people use the same User-agent, both uses are counted against the same limit, so it's better to choose a User-agent that has a unique name. If this block of code results in an error for you (so that `reddit.text` displays as `'{\"message\": \"Too Many Requests\", \"error\": 429}'`), then change `DS6001` to something else, and it should work. \n",

    "To save the metadata in the data frame, use the `meta` parameter, set equal to a list of paths for each metadata feature you wish to store in the dataframe. In this case, to save the \"kind\" feature and the \"after\" feature within the \"data\" branch, I type `meta = ['kind', ['data', 'after']]`. Finally, because there is already a `kind` feature stored within the records, I must distinguish the metadata feature with a prefix. I use `meta_prefix='meta'` to place \"meta\" prior to the column names of the metadata.\n",
